[Mary-Anne] 00:01
But. As you all are approaching a town, you see the gates, which are in front of you. But you also. Um. You also see a lake. And. That's, you know, ways off? Like? Like East, you see a figure heading towards the lake and he has. What looks like he's carrying a sack? So those are the two things as you are emerging through the woods after fighting your scarecrow and fighting the willowisp. Um. You see a figure heading towards the lake and? The town Gates with its bloody dead wolf heads hanging from Pikes.


Mmm


Speaker 2   01:00
Paste.


Speaker 1   01:02
Ominous,


Speaker 2   01:03
But


Speaker 1   01:06
Spooky,


Speaker 2   01:07
Yeah.


Speaker 1   01:08
The figure is not walking very steadily. If you all want to roll perception checks to see if you can gather any more details about the figure.


Would you say?


Speaker 2   01:28
I'll do a perception. Okay, cool.


Speaker 1   01:34
Shit.


Speaker 2   01:36
Yeah, she got a 23. You got a


Speaker 1   01:38
23. Yeah, oh, very nice. Okay. The sack looks like it's moving. Oh, like, there's some. There's some twitching in there in the sack. So, would you all as a party like to approach there's Gates to continue on, or would you like to divert your party and head towards the man carrying a sack that looks like it might be twitching. Well,


Speaker 2   02:04
What did you need to roll? Because, yeah, exactly. I


Speaker 1   02:08
Did not know. Yeah, Ella enrolled at 23. So she would have. Would you have shared that with the party?


Speaker 2   02:16
Yes. Okay. Where's perception? Check on the mobile. Um, it's in the middle, so you would go to skills. Not that one. This skills okay, cool, and then the phone's laid out differently for sure. There it is, I have plus zero. That's great.


Speaker 1   02:35
So,


Speaker 2   02:41
I don't know what I what I noticed, like wriggling in the the unsteady man's gate


Speaker 1   02:45
With S16. I don't think you would notice it. The movement? Um, but with the 23, that's pretty good. Saint elowin would notice with her, oh eyes.


Uh, oh, do me next. As we see you approaching, the guards are shouting up. Hulk, who goes there?


Speaker 2   03:27
Well, hold on. I mean, so, where's this? So what? Why is the sack Wrigley? I think he's going to go drown some wolves or something.


Speaker 1   03:38
And he's just carrying on towards the lake.


So the towns have been away from the weight Lake.


Speaker 2   03:46
How big is the sack? I think how big is this sack too?


Speaker 1   03:49
With a 20,


Speaker 2   03:51
I mean, okay, a perception check that I see how big it is.


Speaker 1   03:57
To see how? The sack is. I mean, with a 23, the the sack could fit, like me, maybe like a large. Um, halfling, or


Speaker 2   04:15
Okay. No,


Speaker 1   04:16
It's not an exceptionally large.


Speaker 2   04:18
It's like a four foot. Oh, I was gonna say so. It's like a full size. It's like a garbage bag. Yeah, it's like, it's like a hefty like, a small. Yeah, yeah,


Speaker 1   04:27
Okay.


Speaker 2   04:34
So, how? So, do we proceed through the gate or go to the man with the brickling garbage bag? Oh, yeah, I was gonna say, I think, are the guards like outside the walls or they,


Speaker 1   04:42
Oh, they're in the walls.


Speaker 2   04:43
So they're like on the walls, and like little posts, or are they like behind, like a slits like they're they're behind


Speaker 1   04:49
The walls? And it looks like they have some weapons ready, like some, uh, Pikes. If they they were questioning you, but it always seems like there's guards at the ready. Ready to poke and prod.


Speaker 2   05:04
Okay, so they have, like, they're like through arrows slits on the other side of the wall on my ground level, right? You know what, I'm saying, okay. The


Speaker 1   05:11
Guy trips with the sack?


Attempts to pick it up again. Takes a minute to hoist it over his shoulder again. I don't know about you. I've never struggled with my sex.


Speaker 2   05:28
Okay.


Speaker 1   05:33
And how close are we to these guards? The you're pretty close to the gate as you emerge it. It was hard to see at first when you went through the woods, but you're now fairly close to the gate itself. Okay. The lake is away from the gate, though, ah. Um, so it makes more sense to address the guards. Well.


Speaker 2   05:57
I'm gonna go after the sack. That's just me. Oh yeah, yeah, sack.


Like, works like, like worst case scenario, is a lot of bad things, but I mean best case scenario. It's like, you know, it's dinner, right? He's got a giant, wrinkled up sack. Oh, not, it was wrinkling. This is King. Yeah, probably fluctuates with the temperature. Yeah.


Food doesn't grow on trees, though, I mean.


Speaker 1   06:33
It


Speaker 2   06:34
Could be food.


Speaker 1   06:34
Okay, so what would you all like to do?


Speaker 2   06:38
Well, let's. Let's have to say, I think we'll. You know where the guards we're gonna go after that other guy? I'm is anybody gonna say anything to the guy? I'm certainly not gonna say anything. Oh, I don't know how to address a man that's carrying a wriggling sack away. Hello there. Sure, I'd like to talk to you about your giant sag. Yeah, you have there so.


Speaker 1   07:01
He's very fuck. If you, if you, he's pretty far away from you all. He's probably like 90 feet away. Not that far, but? It doesn't seem to be paying if you shout out. He doesn't seem to be paying attention. He's not.


Speaker 2   07:14
He's not walking particularly quickly. Is he? No,


Speaker 1   07:17
He's struggling a bit.


Speaker 2   07:18
He's struggling. I, I have an idea about how to talk to him. And I guess I'll approach him.


Speaker 1   07:27
Okay. So? As you get closer, it becomes apparent. The fog, the Mist kind of covers. Every inch of brovian. Sometimes it moves away, but sometimes it prevents you from seeing fairly far ahead. But as you, as you all get closer to him and? By default, the lake, you notice he's heading towards a boat that's kind of parked at the edge of the lake.


Speaker 2   07:57
See, excuse me. Excuse me, sir. You look like you did a head with that. Seems like


Speaker 1   08:04
He's rushing more. Oh sir,


Speaker 2   08:07
Don't saunter off


Speaker 1   08:08
Starting to get into the boat. Um. At first tries to put the sack and gingerly, but he's not quite strong. He just tosses the second. Um, as soon as he throws the sack in the sack kind of moves like a flopped fish. Um.


Speaker 2   08:31
I really like, I don't hear any noise from the sack or anything, though. I mean, how close am I at this point? Like, if I'm striding with a purpose after him, is she tearing some paper up?


Speaker 1   08:40
What is she doing? Probably


Speaker 2   08:41
Let me see.


Speaker 1   08:48
She is shredding, something


Speaker 2   08:49
She's angry.


Speaker 1   08:51
She is mad.


Speaker 2   08:52
What's it means flirting?


That


Speaker 1   08:59
Part was so bad. I still remember in the car.


Speaker 2   09:06
Um, I know


Speaker 1   09:08
Anyway. Yeah, um. If you, if you want to hear something, how about? How do you guys give me, uh, give me a roll? We could do another


Speaker 2   09:17
History check. It's


Speaker 1   09:20
Not a history, so remind


Speaker 2   09:22
Me how?


Speaker 1   09:24
These out. The boat tosses the the sack ends like a flat fish moving around. How close are we now? Are we still just here, you all are fairly close now. He was moving out of snail's pace and you all are hearty adventurers, and you caught up to him quite quickly. So I. Can I rush up to the boat to try and? Just hold him from doing something. Would you like to Halt the hold the boat or, um, grab him?


I'd like to grab him. Okay. Um, how about you do a strength check?


Speaker 2   10:10
And.


Oh my God, he has Advantage.


Speaker 1   10:16
He does not have Advantage.


Speaker 3   10:20
Oh.


Speaker 1   10:21
Oh, so that's a. He rolled in that one,


Speaker 2   10:25
Oh, oh,


Speaker 1   10:26
Disadvantage, because he is intoxicated. So? Broden, how? How are you holding him?


Speaker 2   10:39
One arm, like on his shoulder


Speaker 1   10:42
Closest to me. And the other hand, or sorry one hand, and then the other hand. Stopping his hand from trying to grab the sack anymore. Okay, like, just try and keep him in place. All right, I mean. There's a place I would like to grab. I mean, he seems to be able to carry a sack pretty well. Okay, can't do that right now. He's gonna try it, despite you getting the upper hand on him. He's gonna try to do like a sleight of hand. Check to people away from you. Again at disadvantaged because, as you notice, he's very intoxicated. Okay, that's a seven. Could you roll against me?


Speaker 2   11:22
We're grappling,


Speaker 1   11:23
Which is grappling, um, oh sorry,


Speaker 2   11:26
Yeah. He's grappling the man under skills.


Jesse's not grappling to fight him. Jesse's grappling him to love him.


Speaker 1   11:37
Sleight of hand. Oh man, I'm not rolling grade 10. Or, he rolled a seven.


Speaker 2   11:42
He's trying to grab him. Come look at the bag. Yeah, get the bag. Okay,


Speaker 1   11:47
The boat is still on the shore. Are we able to catch up to him, and he wasn't able to take off with it. Yeah, nice, right?


Speaker 2   11:54
Okay, so? Yeah, then I would. I would go to grab the bag. I'm reasonably strong enough. I would assume I could just kind of pick it up. And


Speaker 1   12:02
Ellen, what are you doing? Try


Speaker 2   12:05
To open it. You know, I was making gonna make my way towards the bag.


Speaker 1   12:08
Okay, Edward, what are you doing?


Speaker 2   12:11
I'm going to be calling towards the gentleman and saying something like? Um, stop resisting. We're not meaning to trouble you, although, uh, you seem to be trafficking a live body, uh, if you don't mind just. We'd like to be on our way as soon as we can, so if you could just? We can make this fast. Stuff sorry, you know,


Speaker 1   12:39
Fuck off.


Speaker 2   12:41
Yeah, it didn't sound like he was the listening type, so that's not a gentlemanly answer. We made no disrespect. I, I had a bad feeling about this, the second he started walking away faster instead of going, huh, what a giant laser called actual.


Speaker 1   12:56
I mean, what he doesn't like, you, he's. He looks very scared abused.


Speaker 2   13:00
Oh, he's racist. Probably, yeah, probably yeah, so I'm going to anyway, I'm going to. I'm going to open this bag, you assumed. It's, like, I just did like a roped bounty at the top or something like that


Speaker 1   13:13
Wasn't even tied up really well. It opens up pretty easily.


Speaker 2   13:17
Okay,


Speaker 1   13:18
Um, wasn't knotted or anything like that. Um. And it, you find? But very sweaty but alive. Young girl who's about the age of 12?


Speaker 2   13:30
Not interesting. Don't be afraid, shot.


Speaker 1   13:36
Fuck you, you asshole, and she's not yelling at you. She's yelling at you. She's yelling at


Speaker 2   13:43
Me, the drunk man,


Speaker 1   13:45
May all your wine taste like water. You dusty old cretin


Speaker 2   13:51
Jesus, and she spits


Speaker 1   13:53
On him. Uh, she's trying to get out of the bag, but she kind of flops more into the boat.


Speaker 2   14:01
I was like, I was, like, hold up, hold on. Let's get you out of the boat, sir. The circumstances aren't looking better for you. Yeah, away from the away from the weird.


Speaker 1   14:09
Yeah, I I tighten my grip on him. He's gonna try to like run off towards the woods. He's gonna my legs


Speaker 2   14:16
May be small.


But my God,


Speaker 1   14:21
He's gonna attempt to kick you in the shin, oh, shit, um. So, I'm gonna just roll like another sliding hand. Okay. Um, okay,


Speaker 2   14:31
Check,


Speaker 1   14:32

I'm a vastani, and I'm not allowed in town, but I just like to hang out with the horses and. All I wanted to do was hang out with the horses and give them some carrots and give them some apples and then this weirdo. Puts me in a stack, and I can't see it smells like freaking ass. I don't know what he was gonna do. I know I'm not allowed in town, but I don't do anything bad. I just want to see the horses. You did nothing wrong. Thank you, I.

It came to me to dream if I threw it in the lake, the the church. Would we? The church would be consecrated again. It would be all it all would be well.


Speaker 2   17:42

Speaker 2   18:10
Oh. Can I take a religion check?


All I know is Jesus Christ, all right. I only got a nine, so maybe I don't know. And we did this last


Speaker 1   18:23
Time did


Speaker 4   18:24
Because


Speaker 2   18:24
I


Speaker 4   18:24
Do remember the morning Lord. Um,

Doing right


Speaker 2   18:45
Doesn't sound like any writing. The morning load that I have heard of?


Speaker 1   18:53
Look, man, you didn't get a dream. At night, I did.


Speaker 2   19:00
To the morning mode. Also tell you to be inebriated during the process.


Speaker 1   19:05
I have a lot of pain. A lot of suffering I? I, we all have faults, and this is, I am working through it.


Speaker 2   19:15
You already found a healthy coping mechanism.


Speaker 1   19:17
Where's the booze? You're not very nice.


Speaker 2   19:23
No, he's not very nice. You're right about that one. He's right,


Speaker 1   19:27
Though. Why her specifically?


The stunning are not well. They can pass through the myths itself. They can leave borovia. They are.


Equal to that of the greatest evil that we should not make.


Speaker 2   19:57
Oh, straw.


Speaker 1   20:01
Do not want to say, snake, bring it down one. What? I'm sorry, Hannah, I whispered. Do not say his name. You will bring it his evil down upon,


Speaker 2   20:13
See look. Does he look like? This is like the meter change when he when he says strong, like,


Speaker 1   20:19
Yes, very fearful.


Speaker 2   20:20
He's just immediately like morphs into, like, do not don't say that, don't say it. Yes, like, go from like sneering, like, whatever, you know, man, whatever,


Speaker 1   20:29
Right?


Speaker 2   20:30
I'll I'll, you know, I was doing whatever to just like immediately cowering.


Speaker 1   20:34
Yes,


Speaker 2   20:35
That scared me,


Speaker 1   20:37
Um, a great son to say this man and the boat. So, I'm still holding him a bit fairly easily. Yeah, he's. And that he's. At this point, he's


Speaker 2   20:49
Used his


Speaker 1   20:51
Strengths to get past you in his fail. Despite being twice your height,


Speaker 2   20:57
I remember like a headlock or something. Or what? How are you holding? And this is this man, who's, like, got two feet on you? Well, you


Speaker 1   21:04
Know. Holding one arm behind his back and stepping on his shin, so he gets down on a knee. Now, we're at the same height. Oh, okay, yeah, you got your behind, so you're behind him. Well, I'm very behind. He can feel the pressure. Oh, yeah, is that a dog? About goes over to your dog, elwin. Reaches out her hand.


Landslide snips. Her hand licks her hand. That's lots of a good boy.


Speaker 4   21:53
A normal dog in the world. Yeah,


Speaker 2   21:56
Bye boy, you're my boy blue,


Speaker 4   21:59
All right, um?


Speaker 2   22:05
So, what? Let me turn this if we turn this man over to the town. Are they gonna do anything about this? I mean, he's clearly a hero. He's still right, he's saving the town.


Speaker 1   22:18
Can you bring him to my daddy instead of bringing him to the town please?


Speaker 2   22:24
And who is your daddy?


Speaker 1   22:27
The head of our village


Speaker 2   22:28
See a nice man.


Speaker 1   22:31
Yeah. Are you a nice man? No,


Speaker 2   22:34
He's very, he's very myself. I've not doing it very long. He's not a nice man.


Speaker 1   22:39
Okay, he's


Speaker 2   22:40
Not a bad guy though.


Speaker 3   22:43
Very


Speaker 2   22:44
Blunt. This is coming from religion man.


Speaker 3   22:53
Put


Speaker 2   22:54
It all in LX. There was no Charisma needed. Actually, I think I do have a Charisma at positive Charisma modifier. I, I actually, I would say I got. I got pretty. I rolled pretty well. So, no, no, I have a negative Charisma modifier. I


Speaker 4   23:05
Have extremely average stats like just slightly above average. So, yeah, I got. I got like a plus two


Speaker 2   23:12
Approach, plus one wisdom.


Speaker 4   23:15
With Matthew, I'm more like, uh,


Speaker 2   23:17
Oh, yeah, of course. It goes on to plus not 20. Last must plus. Um.


Speaker 1   23:33
Okay.


Head to the village.


Speaker 2   23:38
I'm fine with that, but is your father going to kill him?


Speaker 1   23:44
Like this fucker deserves to live anyway. He was gonna throw me in that damn Lake, and there's a monster in that Lake. What?


Speaker 2   23:55
To be honest, girl. It seems like there are boxers everywhere here. That's a fair


Speaker 1   23:59
Point. That's a lake monster. That's scary. We haven't even seen it, but we know it's in there.


Speaker 2   24:05
Don't seem like Master. I kind of want to see the lake monster though. I, I'm sorry, I'm getting distracted.


He most certainly was trying to drown you in that Lake, so.


Um.


Speaker 1   24:29
I don't know. My dad's probably worried I snuck out last night so? Let's go, I'm


Speaker 2   24:36
Gonna go home.


Speaker 1   24:43
Okay, what? I didn't mean to do that. No, no,


Speaker 2   24:47
You're good.


Speaker 1   24:47
She rolled. She rolled an inside check. Oh. I mean, you could roll an Insight check except tube is really gonna go home.


Speaker 2   24:56
Uh, um. To see if she's actually gonna go home.


So she


Speaker 4   25:04
Was already in trouble. How did how did he?


Speaker 1   25:07
Put her in the sand come, I'm right. In the next, I don't know,


Speaker 2   25:09
Picked her up and put her in the tent,


Speaker 4   25:11
Just using talks kid, but she said that he


Speaker 1   25:14
Puts her inside okay and talk to command the question of the crew.


Speaker 2   25:17
I'm assuming I'm assuming a semi-malnourished peasant girl is probably not particularly difficult to get into a sack when. You know,


Speaker 1   25:24
A grown man?


Speaker 2   25:26
Yeah, yeah. What


Speaker 1   25:27
Was she doing out so late? She snuck out, yeah?


Speaker 2   25:38
Yeah, um. I don't know. So,


Speaker 1   25:41
Do you guys fight things?


Speaker 2   25:44
This, let me be fighting.


Speaker 1   25:46
That's cool. We don't fight things. We just. Gotta go around. Yeah. I guess we eat a lot, and we have, you know? It's a good time.


Speaker 3   26:00
Then,


Speaker 4   26:01
Why does he say that you're evil?


Speaker 1   26:04
Because he's he's, he's racist, he's


Speaker 2   26:07
He's famous,


Speaker 1   26:09
He's stupid, he's. Drunk. And he smells. And he doesn't. He's no one loves him, all right. No, you're not married. You old man?


Really coming there. Okay, so. What are we doing because I'm just kind of sitting on this guy?


Speaker 2   26:40
I'm not comfortable. Condemning this man to die myself, but? I am comfortable giving him to this girl's father to decide what to do with. I agree.


Speaker 1   26:58
To Daddy bastani.


Speaker 2   26:59
Well, maybe he begs well. Huh? That's fair. Not. I've not have not been impressed thus far. You make a good plea. Yeah, old man, I'm going to. Yeah, I'm going to be honest there, uh, Pluto. Did you say your name was, I'm not not impressed to thus far with your chances, sorry?


Speaker 1   27:15
My name's John?


Speaker 2   27:19
Okay, all right, John. Can we roll anything to see if he's lying?


Speaker 1   27:23
You can roll an Insight check


Speaker 2   27:24
Inside Chad, and so check. My insight score is. Oh, dirty, 20. 16.


Speaker 1   27:37
Ah, dirty. Thank you Cricket.


Speaker 2   27:42
A 23. I checked his ass for


Speaker 1   27:47
Anybody. Just check, I just think I had. I don't care what you say


Speaker 2   27:51
Your name is with you.


Speaker 1   27:53
As you guys have stood here, quite a while, this lake is huge mm, and like the fucking Lake, you made me and Jesse.


On the opposite side of the bank, you see this just for? Go ahead and roll a perception check. It's just out of the corner of your eye. If do you guys all want to roll a perception check? I would okay. If anybody's gonna see it, it's not me. I don't think you could do worse.


Speaker 2   28:30
Only his guitar has a chance of saying it. Now,


Speaker 1   28:34
No, nobody rolled higher than a nine.


Speaker 2   28:38
Well, I mean, I have a passive perception of 16, but like, okay,


Speaker 1   28:42
I rolled an hour. For us.


Speaker 2   28:45
I rolled a seven, yeah.


Speaker 1   28:47
What did you roll


Speaker 2   28:48
And now I rolled a nine? Why


Speaker 1   28:51
Did you roll an eight? You guys don't see anything?


Speaker 2   28:56
We're, we're trash.


Speaker 1   28:57
I mean, you just see, it's a big fucking Lake. Yeah, I'm


Speaker 2   29:00
Too. I'm too distracted because I'm getting rope out of my back and I'm about to start tying this guy.


Speaker 1   29:04
I'm trying to get my what I'm saying.


Speaker 2   29:07
Rodent over here, pushing again. His, uh, my rope is only for celibate purposes. I can't. Yeah.


Speaker 1   29:19
I'm, uh, I'm still holding him. Am I like able to check his pockets? Yeah, you can check his pocket all right, I might, you know? Yes, a little bit, but? And you're, like, oh yeah, is that a dagger?


Speaker 4   29:33
Are you just it's not that sharp?


Speaker 1   29:37
All right, um? Yeah,


Speaker 2   29:40
Searching for shiny things. Bro.


Speaker 1   29:43
Oh, well, okay, so I. Check his one packet. I don't know how many packets he's got reaching any crevice after. After checking his belongings, he has a pebble.


Speaker 2   29:56
He's probably what is the pebble?


Speaker 1   29:59
He's just smooth, big, large pedal. It's a nice Pebble. It's


Speaker 2   30:04
A nice, nice Pebble. It's a yeah, you got his good ride like MLS hold on to that thing. And I'll take his bevel all


Speaker 1   30:11
Right.


Speaker 2   30:11
Does he distressed by that?


Speaker 1   30:15
He doesn't even notice he's looking towards the town, but really eyeing the woods. He seems a bit indecisive. He doesn't like his predicament right now. You've got


Speaker 4   30:30
Some explaining to do.


Speaker 2   30:31
Sadly, Faith put me on your path. You cannot run from me, because if you try to run, I will simply paralyze you. Then, I will hit you about the head with this base until you stop moving. And then I will take you to that girl's father unconscious.


So, Carol that intimidation checklist, I guess,


Speaker 1   30:52
For sure.


Are you guys gonna follow arabelle?


Speaker 2   31:11
Yeah, once we've tied once we've tied the shut up.


Speaker 4   31:15
Yeah.


Speaker 1   31:17
So, this boat does it have any kind of way to secure it and him? To like a dock, or like, where we are? Any rope that I can just tie him


Speaker 4   31:28
To the boat, so he's not moving the boat's not moving. Oh,


Speaker 2   31:30
Every. Every good Adventure has his rope.


Speaker 1   31:33
Why would you like to drop him at the boat and head to the camp? Oh well, I would like to use the rub to tie him.


Speaker 4   31:42
Um, okay.


Speaker 2   31:44
Yeah, I've got. I've got. I've got at least. I think I have a hundred feet. I have at least 50. I've double checked. My,


Speaker 1   31:50
Oh, okay, but that's right. Yeah, that's my bad. I forgot about that. No, you're good. No, we've four pounds. Oh, that's robe,


Speaker 2   31:58
Okay. Boy, however, Rose four pounds. Yeah. The fuck is, who's role plays four pounds?


Speaker 1   32:07
Is this not in our equipment? Maybe it is okay,


Speaker 2   32:15
It's probably Adventure's backpack, but I'll just I'll just use mine. It does not take 50 feet of rope to tie up one guy's hands and legs. He's just, he's just. I just got him like on a leash. Oh yeah, yeah, I'll be taking that Japanese rope time finish the next level. I've got a leash for him. Again, entirely celibate. And he's entirely bound. Yeah, no, he's he's pretty bad.


Speaker 1   32:39
So, all right, so he's bound. So, we walk, uh, are we going to? Yeah, we'll go. Yeah, I guess


Speaker 2   32:45
We're gonna follow Arabella into the camp


Speaker 1   32:48
After you all tie him up really well, Harveyelle. Really, just. Kicks them hard in the nuts. And then she just.


Speaker 5   32:59
There's


Speaker 1   32:59
A little twirl and just starts walking off. And towards her camp spit up, um? It's pretty good. Sounds like he's about to throw up a little bit, but he holds it in cool. Gotta check that all right. Um, the vistani Camp is not far away from the town. Um, they're not allowed in the town, so they're kind of. I mean, closer to the woods than they are to the gates, um. But it's visible.


Speaker 2   33:32
What time is it?


Speaker 1   33:34
It's still a


Speaker 2   33:35
Tight deadline.


Speaker 1   33:36
Oh, that's right, would you rather go okay? Well, I think I think you all, oh, go ahead, Hannah.


I don't know if we said we, we have the deadline from the first session.


Speaker 4   33:49
Um, nine o'clock.


Speaker 2   33:52
At the water dragon.


The bad dragon man.


Speaker 1   33:59
Oh yeah, the blue water in five o'clock. I'd say it's probably four now. Ah, we want one through the wood spot. How


Speaker 2   34:08
Long does it take to get to the camp?


Speaker 1   34:12
I don't know. It's right there. Okay, it's


Speaker 2   34:15
Just a couple minutes.


We could time and leave him, and


Speaker 1   34:22
Then come back. You could just leave.


Speaker 2   34:24
Could just we could just tie him to the tree?


Speaker 1   34:28
Great. But, yeah,


Speaker 2   34:29
Any trick? There's trees everywhere. We down to the wolf head Pike.


Speaker 1   34:38
If we're right there. Well, if I go home, will you guys promise to visit?


Okay. I'll check up. My dad's lavage. He's the head of our village.


Speaker 2   34:55
Okay, so we can ask for lavage when we show up, and everybody will know


Speaker 1   34:59
Or me. Everyone knows me okay,


Speaker 2   35:01
Fair enough. Well, ask for one of you two after we've met an esteemed Bitcoinance of ours.


Speaker 1   35:11
Okay, we're gonna


Speaker 2   35:12
Tie this old man up to a tree.


Speaker 1   35:14
And where do we find you in town? What tree, but


Speaker 2   35:17
You know there's plenty of trees? There's a forest right there. You just find a nice tree. Is everybody okay with finding a tree to what tie him up to yeah?


Speaker 1   35:28
Maybe


Speaker 2   35:30
We should just take it? So, who is taken to the Village exactly? The father, exactly? Who is the person we are meeting that is so important? To Father, oh oh, you mean, ivina, yes?


Wow, you know? There's all manner of way to describe it, but let's just say that she is currently our caller and beckoner on our particular Quest that we've now found ourselves in. Although in your case? Uh, that she was not.


Who this woman is,


Speaker 1   36:12
Matthew stroking?


Speaker 2   36:14
This is Broden's. Lover's sister.


Speaker 1   36:22
Gotcha,


Speaker 2   36:23
Okay, who may understood? Have known the best of us to some degree. That's great. Um, like, I don't know, like a professional sense, or sure.


Speaker 1   36:37
For me, strictly business Matthew, strictly a pleasure.


But do we have enough time? We got one hour,


Speaker 2   36:49
Got one out,


Speaker 4   36:50
But arabelle said. Just like.


Speaker 1   36:55
Not far from town. Yeah, like, is it just? Should we throw this guy in the Looney bin and then we


Speaker 2   37:01
Could throw him in the Looney, then, well, we could just bring him to the village and leave him in the village. But how long we don't know how long it takes to get?


Speaker 1   37:10
Weren't far from the guards. From the cards. Yeah, we weren't too far right from at the gate. No, after this, when you exited the woods, you were fairly closely gaze. Okay.


Speaker 2   37:23
Um. Wave one out. Well, how about this? How about?


I go with Arabella and this guy back to the camp. And then you all can meet up with this Irena person, and I will find you in town at the at the Blue Water Inn, you said.


Speaker 1   37:46
Blue, Dragon end,


Speaker 2   37:47
Blue dragon, the blue dragon, bad dragon.


Speaker 1   37:52
Um, the hassling again,


Speaker 2   37:54
The Patty dragon, the dragon who could get it in


Speaker 1   37:57
The dragon, who can get it into him


Speaker 2   38:00
Okay. Could you


Speaker 1   38:02
Do that again? Who can't get it in? Are you comfortable doing that alone? I will go with him as well. Well, so


Speaker 2   38:15
We're all in agreement.


Speaker 1   38:18
Ellen and arabelle to the vistani camp and Edward and Broden to the Blue Water. Okay.


Speaker 2   38:27
Yeah. I give you this as a sign of the party's trust, and I'll hold out my hand.


Speaker 1   38:40
And I will put. I will put the bevel in it. Thanks, mister. No,


Speaker 2   38:48
No.


Speaker 1   38:51
Look at. That


Speaker 2   38:52
Is


Speaker 1   38:53
Actually Edward. That


Speaker 2   38:55
Is a valuable sign amongst my people. Quite a bit of judgment here, and I didn't judge any of this.


Speaker 1   39:06
This feels very one-sided. You, you judged? Thanks! Mister reluctantly puts it in her pocket, Dawson.


Ah, now, did we actually know his name? You didn't ask. Oh, shit


Speaker 2   39:30
The booth man. I'm trying


Speaker 1   39:31
Finding an idea, um.


Speaker 2   39:35
Gave up the possession. That was in my backpack,


Speaker 1   39:39
And now it's cool.


Intimidates him.


Speaker 2   39:45
What


Speaker 1   39:46
Is his name?


Speaker 2   39:48
Dickhead, yes.


Speaker 1   39:50
Okay,


Speaker 2   39:52
Drunk, old man. Are you


Speaker 1   39:54
Taking? The man with you to the vistani Camp. Oh


Speaker 2   39:58
Yeah, yeah, that was. That was my goal, I want. I don't want this guy to be eaten by wolves or Escape. I don't know why I love those things to happen. I want him to be get Justice, not okay, just


Speaker 1   40:08
Be


Speaker 2   40:08
Left to die pointlessly, you know?


Speaker 1   40:13
All right. So, how about we? Deal with the bistani camp first. Okay, l-o-n with elwin and skaton and toe with arabelle and the drunken man, the drunkard. Trunkard. Okay. All right. As you guys make your way towards the camp, there's beautiful tents set up, um. Several wagons. There's music playing and. There's some dancing you can see going on. To Hennessy. Okay, yeah, yeah, okay, um? As you get closer. There's a male figure. Um, who kind of it was watching you guys approach. But as you guys get closer? Um.


It's arabelle arabelle. And he calls out. Other people join in about 10 or 12. Um, officeani. And. They're clapping. Um, a man runs up. Uh, an Arabelle runs up to him, jumps up into his arms. Oh, my little girl, oh my little girl. Where were you, you snuck out. Where did you go? You're not supposed to go into town.


Daddy. Got that man, like a fish. Oh, oh, he, and


Speaker 2   42:04
She's


Speaker 1   42:04
Gonna try to kick him again.


Speaker 2   42:05
She's a problem.


Speaker 1   42:06
He, he put me in a damn sack that smelled like, shit, hey, he tried to throw me into the fucking Lake to the monster. He's a pervert. And an ugly old man. And nobody loves him. And I want him dead.


Adventurers. I am lavage. And Ellen. He's looking at you and skaton. Are, are you the Rescuers of my little girl? Yes, we stopped this man from taking her into the lake. On a boat, and after you confirm that, um.


Alexi, and he's calling out someone else. Alexi. Uh, several minutes go by as you guys are casually talking. A lavage is a. He's got like this nice dad bod, um. A man bond on the top of his head auburn hair. Um, tan skin.


Doesn't have any rings on.


Speaker 2   43:36
Does that matter? They don't have. They don't have Diamond corporations in this universe. Some


Speaker 1   43:42
People, still, you know, this is.


Um. Alexi comes up. He sees Arabella, and he just got his face, goes white. Lavash. I'm so sorry, she. And lovash is pissed. You are supposed to be watching her. You keep watch at night and she snuck out. You have shit eyes.


To direct peoples, um?


Lavage looks at l-o-n and skatam. Thank you for asking, rescuing my little girl. Whenever you need Aid, we are. We are here to help. We don't have much. We live a very simple life, but.


Our home is your home. You always have a tent with us place with us.


Well, thank you. We were just mostly concerned about. Your daughter's safety. We don't need any things well. Well, I our praise. Oh, thanks! Thanks! I appreciate that I and what was your name? Hello, one! Ellen. Beautiful and graceful. I appreciate your. I appreciate your Aid I. I,


Speaker 2   45:23
I


Speaker 1   45:23
Only have my little girl. My wife has long since gone and. It was an awful night without her here. She is very. Precocious, and he kind of looks to her. Very adventurous, and she knows not to go in town, but she does anyway. She has a love for horses, despite us having a plethora of horses here.


Yeah, but they don't take care of the horses in their dad. They just. They like, they're skinny, and they're miserable, and their eyes are sad. If sad eyes.


Speaker 2   46:10
Everything in this land has sad eyes.


Speaker 1   46:16
And you?


Speaker 2   46:17
Iams guitar. Cleric of silica.


Speaker 1   46:28
I know of her. Good, beautiful,


Speaker 2   46:32
Good good! It seems like this land is utterly devoted to this the morning world.


Speaker 1   46:40
Ah, well, I don't follow it, follow it either way, but whatever one chooses to follow is whatever is in your heart. Of course,


Speaker 2   46:49
It is always a personal choice. Yes.


Speaker 1   46:51
But


Speaker 2   46:52
As any race, there are some things you may be able to help us with, though perhaps some information.


Speaker 1   46:59
It kind of gestures to Ariel to go towards the camp, and she leaves you all goes to the camp.


Because of goodbye.


Speaker 2   47:12
Oh yeah,


Speaker 1   47:13
She spits at the man.


Speaker 2   47:15
Yeah, he's a he's a weirdo. Oh. What is he doing? Is he groveling, or what is he just kind of like


Speaker 1   47:22
He, like, gone? Like, he's hung, he's hanging. He's really limps right now. Um, and every now and then, he tries to like, test your hold on him, but you've got quite cold, and he he's not, and he's already tied up quite tightly. He seems quite defeated and quite miserable. He's already feed himself a little bit. He's not in a great position.


Speaker 2   47:46
No, he's gonna say I thought I was hoping I broke it as well, though. No, he's not.


Speaker 1   47:50
He's not doing great. He's still fresh. Well.


Hannah, do you hear Cricket? A little bit.


Speaker 2   48:03
So, do you hear me pretending to be? As you can see, you can see Cricket, though


Speaker 1   48:07
Okay, and secretly I can see Cricket. That's nice.


Do you hear that? Yeah, okay. She's far. Are you able to see? I can see Hannah, yeah. Hi Creek, hi quickie. Yeah, just


Speaker 2   48:28
Chill out.


Speaker 1   48:28
Um, yeah, but he's, he's. He's quite broken.


Speaker 2   48:34
This cat's insane. Obviously, she she will not say either. Laugh if you want or two, but she will immediately. She'll just sit here. We'll set at your feeding demand. Pets,


Speaker 1   48:45
Yeah.


Speaker 2   48:48
All right. Have you heard of? I imagine you have heard of her. Um, but a lady watch her walked her. Water.


Speaker 1   49:03
Walker.


Speaker 2   49:05
Sounds about right?


Speaker 1   49:10
She lives in town.


Speaker 2   49:13
Jim, an important person or.


Speaker 1   49:17
I don't. I'm not allowed in town, and I could only hear I've heard of her. Like? Heard of many names. Some people in town visit, but she does not visit the camp. I


Speaker 2   49:30
Was going to ask, is there do they? If you're not allowed in town, are they allowed here? I would imagine, so we've certainly welcome


Speaker 1   49:38
All visitors.


Would you all like wine and food?


Sure. Sure.


Kisses both of your cheeks, katani. He brings you in kisses both of your cheeks eloin. He brings you in kisses both of your cheeks, um. Squeezes you tight. Thank you for saving my little girl I.


Would be nothing without her.


We have. The shortage. There is a shortage of wine in the village, but we have. Quite the selection of wine. We have several Reds and whites. Nice Chardonnay


Speaker 2   50:34
I have. I have no real taste for the stuff, whatever, whatever, whatever you can spare.


Speaker 1   50:42
We have orange juice if that is for your taste. The kids like it? Orange juice.


Speaker 2   50:50
No, the wine is. The wine is quite fine champagne wine


Speaker 1   50:54
For. And wine for the beautiful Halloween.


Speaker 2   51:01
Someone will get an event.


Speaker 1   51:04
Okay, they break and bring a bowl of wine for you, skatan. Did


Speaker 2   51:11
They bring a bowl of wine to her, too? They bring a


Speaker 1   51:13
Okay. Does he get a glass? They bring a glass.


Speaker 2   51:15
Oh, my goodness.


Speaker 1   51:21
Damn this bunch around you, animal


Speaker 2   51:26
Your name Lords. I thought I took notes from


Speaker 1   51:30
This glass, a glass you fools, a glass. And he, he sips from it. And he, he steps from the bowl, you see him sit from it, and someone else brings you a glass.


Speaker 2   51:44
Thank you, you fools. Two. I never, despite my appearance. I am not any simple Barbarian. I'm not. Not from these lands. It's very dreary lands.


Speaker 1   52:02
I guess they are quite dreary if you can't leave them.


Speaker 2   52:08
Do you find them particularly cheerful?


Speaker 1   52:11
We don't mind it. Don't mind, we


Speaker 2   52:13
Have protection here


Speaker 1   52:14
Nuts. I don't. Or something


Speaker 2   52:19
And liking it are two different things.


Speaker 1   52:23
Well, I said there's danger all around, but at least here there's safety, despite its appearances. We will not be harmed. By the land itself.


Speaker 2   52:40
Clearly, you're not safe among its people.


Speaker 1   52:42
No, at the end of the day, human beings. Prove time and time again.


Bunch of assholes distasteful Halloween. Yes, I appreciate your bluntness.


Speaker 2   53:02
Is there anything you would perhaps be able to share then?


Speaker 1   53:05
You've


Speaker 2   53:06
Left these lands then? Are you familiar with? Pharaoh. Neverwinter.


Speaker 1   53:16
Well, I don't travel very far, but? Other vastani do? You could travel wherever we pleased to I'm back.


Um,


Speaker 2   53:31
Is it true that we cannot?


Speaker 1   53:33
Have you tried?


Speaker 2   53:36
No, but I heard it from a very good Source. This seemed like a very good source that bun cannot. And based on the things I have experienced since wandering through the Mists into this place seems accurate. I was wandering through the midst of my group, for it felt like hours before he finally escaped his clutches. And no one else here seems to have heard of where I am from.


Speaker 1   54:02
Where are you from? Neverwinter. Well,


Speaker 2   54:05
I've traveled many up and down the sword Coast.


Speaker 1   54:08
Sword Coast yes, many years ago, I was there.


Speaker 2   54:17
Where were you? Do you remember?


Speaker 1   54:20
Gives you some town,


Speaker 2   54:22
Some


Speaker 1   54:22
Room. He's been there


Speaker 2   54:23
Okay. Some, like, torm's held, like, oh, okay,


Speaker 1   54:28
Some


Speaker 4   54:28
Random Backwater,


Speaker 2   54:29
Where they probably sold snake oil. Oh yeah. Jessie's a snake oil?


Speaker 1   54:38
Cool! What brings you all to velocity? Is that where you're headed?


Speaker 2   54:45
This is somewhere to be. Tis


Speaker 1   54:49
A. Not a town. I would recommend.


Speaker 2   54:59
Slim pickings. In a land like this?


Speaker 1   55:06
I'd say it. It does have its beauty, but. It is. Certainly a sight to behold at night.


But I appreciate your? The fact that you've risked your lives, Ellen and skatan.


If you need Aid, I we are here.


Speaker 2   55:49
I can't think of any relative questions.


Speaker 1   55:54
Well. This is our come. If you always, you can come by whenever you'd like,


Speaker 2   56:00
Of course.


Speaker 1   56:02
I'm always here, but other vastani. We travel fairly, but as the head of the village I I stay behind, so always come seek me out, and he looks at Eloin.


Speaker 2   56:18
This is a single daddy. It's a


Speaker 1   56:20
Single dad. Okay,


Speaker 2   56:21
It's a single dance. Okay, yeah, single dad


Speaker 1   56:25
Single. Yeah, okay.


Speaker 2   56:26
I'm a single dad if I've ever heard a sign,


Speaker 4   56:28
Right? Great for a one-night stand. Can we get that description again?


Speaker 1   56:31
Yeah. Hi Jill. Probably like? It's probably like almost six foot. It's got a bad bod, tan skin, man bun, auburn hair. Oh yeah, yeah,


Speaker 2   56:45
She got wine long, swingy dick.


Um,


Speaker 1   56:55
Okay.


Speaker 2   56:58
What are you going to do with him and I'll just nudge the tied up guy? Where does he still here because I assume did we get led over to like a different tent, or are we just kind of like they were bringing wine?


Speaker 1   57:10
Lexi and another male. Alexa, you hit the individual who was being yelled at by lavash and another male came and took him away. Okay.


Speaker 2   57:23
Yeah, but um, did he answer my question? Then I still asked the question a little gesture to him. That's how I asked the question, though I'm going to kill


Speaker 1   57:29
Him. Oh, fair enough.


Speaker 2   57:33
It's a dead man.


Speaker 1   57:34
Hey Dawn, I've never liked this man, he. Hi. Drunkered for years, racist throws things at our camp. At a time year a year ago.


Tried lighting it on fire, but lit himself on fire it.


I won't lose sleep with him. Dead is all I'm saying. His name was blue toe. Don't know the? Surname.


Speaker 2   58:15
I don't think I can't imagine it would matter much.


Speaker 1   58:17
Sorry, am I picking you?


Speaker 2   58:18
No, it's okay, I just need to make sure I was just saying it was bigger or not.

Speaker 2   58:59
Yes, she is. I'm getting late.


Speaker 1   59:11
Okay, do you guys? Would you guys wish to stay at the camp? They would offer you a tent, or would you like to meet Edward? In town at Edward and Broden in town after we like. Drop the guy off like? Done all of that.


Speaker 2   59:35
I, I mean, I personally would have been like,


Speaker 1   59:39
Yeah, it doesn't make sense to go meet them in town. Yeah, yeah, I was, like,

Speaker 1   1:01:25
Okay. You guys, head to the gates, leave the camp, and head towards the city gates. So,


Speaker 2   1:01:34
I guess we crashed. We probably crashed their little thing at some point while they're going. Right? We have a new little conversation with with.


Speaker 1   1:01:45
I won't do this with aloe one and skaton. But I'll have Broden and Edward go ahead and talk to the town scars.


Speaker 2   1:02:04
I was hoping it'd have to be a loser man talking my way past the guards.


Speaker 4   1:02:09
So,


Speaker 2   1:02:10
I mean, you know, higher?


Speaker 4   1:02:13

Speaker 1   1:02:31
Okay, are you? You guys are at the gates.


Speaker 2   1:02:36
Sure, all right.


Oblivion, remake, sure.


Speaker 1   1:02:47
Hello, stay your identity. Do you have any weapons? What is your purpose?


Speaker 2   1:02:55
Okay. Um, I can't remember the order of the questions. Names are Edward and Broden. Uh, weapons. Yes,


Speaker 4   1:03:06
We are always packing. Yeah,


Speaker 2   1:03:08
Weapons positives always packed.


Speaker 1   1:03:13
Um, purpose, there's an inn we'd like to go to.


Speaker 2   1:03:19
Uh, the Blue Water app. Uh, was there any other questions?


Speaker 1   1:03:25
No, that's it. Oh sorry, one more thing.


Yeah, what do you am? I allowed to say it. Are you sure? I'm sorry, it's my first day on the job.


Speaker 2   1:03:43
You're doing a great job.


Speaker 1   1:03:44
What is your opinion? Are you sure of? Okay, I'm going to say it. What is your opinion of stride? So,


Speaker 2   1:03:58
You're gonna have to say it again. I didn't quite hear it the first time.


Speaker 1   1:04:02
Jeremy, could you do it for me? Stropped. What is your opinion of straw one more


Speaker 2   1:04:08
Time?


Speaker 1   1:04:11
I heard you the first time, um.


Speaker 2   1:04:15
Weapons, positive stride, negative


Speaker 1   1:04:21
Jeremy. They said their neck, they don't like him.


And after an awkward moment. And the squealing gate opens just enough for you to squeeze through.


Speaker 4   1:04:43
Oh.


Speaker 2   1:04:52
Golden


Speaker 1   1:04:52
Likes it tight.


Speaker 4   1:04:53
Oh yeah, where there's a channel line.


Speaker 1   1:05:00
Call me the Suez, because I'm,


Speaker 4   1:05:02
Oh yeah, I'm known to, uh, be frequent to come and go and some gutters.


Speaker 2   1:05:09
I thought I thought it was what eighth of the world's Maritime driver crosses you okay?


Speaker 1   1:05:15
As you walk in, you're greeted by an older guard, very Stern, and then. Younger, more charismatic guard.


Speaker 2   1:05:28
It's not very good. Which one of you two fine gentlemen is Jeremy?


Speaker 1   1:05:35
Jeremy is the the taller one, the the more Stern one. I am Jeremy, Jeremy. Yes,


Speaker 2   1:05:43
I'm sure your mentee appreciates your guidance. Wisdom, I'm


Speaker 1   1:05:47
Sure, Thursday, first day, yeah. You've all had a first day. Sure, yeah, it's not


Speaker 2   1:05:54
An easy


Speaker 1   1:05:54
Job.


Speaker 2   1:05:55
And this is our first day here.


Speaker 1   1:05:57
Yes, and do you


Speaker 2   1:05:59
Mind letting us know where we might find this in?


Speaker 1   1:06:03
Just points ahead.


Straight down. Okay.


Speaker 2   1:06:18
That's easy enough. Uh,


Speaker 4   1:06:20
Yeah, nothing came out there.


Speaker 1   1:06:22
Hi, and this is Jeremy. I mean, this is, this is another guy. This is another guy, younger guy. Hello! Hi,


Speaker 4   1:06:30
Quick question for you.


Speaker 1   1:06:31
Yes, what


Speaker 4   1:06:33
Is your opinion that's strong?


Speaker 1   1:06:34
Oh, oh, it's okay, Jeremy. I got this. Okay, you can't say his name anymore. You're in here. Now you're in veloci. You can't say his name, don't say his name.


All will be, well, if you don't say his name.


Speaker 2   1:06:54
It's not a fan. Noted. I appreciate the instructional help. And how was your first sake?


Speaker 1   1:07:07
Honestly, it's been a little bit hard. Um, I, I don't know. You get yelled at a lot. Um, I'm not used to that and. You know it. It's okay, I think that if you, you know, as Jeremy says, you just, you know, you need to just keep your eyes forward and


Speaker 2   1:07:25
You're doing a great job. Thank you.


Speaker 1   1:07:31
Um, fight forward. I appreciate that. He's, he's passionate and generous.


Speaker 2   1:07:44
Probably don't see a lot of dwarves in it, and it's quite frankly, you can't reach all the way as high, you know, so?


Speaker 1   1:07:59
Right? So


Speaker 2   1:08:00
You're never gonna get a high five.


Speaker 1   1:08:03
That's true. Well, you've done a great job.


Speaker 2   1:08:05
You in Germany,


Speaker 1   1:08:08
Keep it up,


Speaker 2   1:08:09
Love it. By the way, you may see a lizard man come through later with an elf. The lizard, probably more striking, visually being a lizard lizard. Want to give you an emotional heads up on your first day? Lizard lizard man, lizard Man combination,


Speaker 1   1:08:25
Got it.


Speaker 4   1:08:26
Yes, everything. Okay?


Good. I'm doing.


Speaker 1   1:08:34
Wonderful! Almost done can clock out six more hours.


Speaker 2   1:08:42
Okay, sounds like you're 2 hours in.


Speaker 1   1:08:47
It's


Speaker 2   1:08:49
Got a long day at it.


Speaker 1   1:08:53
It's right around the corner


Speaker 2   1:08:54
Is the other night. No, he's on the night shift.


Speaker 4   1:08:56
Yeah,


Speaker 2   1:08:56
He's not that Asian on the night shift he


Speaker 4   1:08:59
Hasn't slept. Yeah, because it's


Speaker 2   1:09:00
What, no, the past? Four, no. Yeah, he's a four o'clock. Now, he's closing. He's he's not my closing shift now. And


Speaker 1   1:09:07
As


Speaker 2   1:09:07
You


Speaker 1   1:09:07
Guys are talking, um Jeremy, the older guard is just going to assess your weapons okay.


I've seen a staff in my day very well. We allow the the right to bear arms is very important. In the Lockheed, you are allowed to have your weapon. We just need to make a note of it. We appreciate your. Cooperation.


Now, alfalfa. He speaks the younger


Speaker 4   1:09:41
Guy. Oh, good, of course. Does he have an elbow?


Speaker 1   1:09:45
You need to check that there are pockets, and he's gonna like rub you down, gonna give you a baby.


Speaker 2   1:09:51
Be careful when you do that to Broden.


Speaker 4   1:09:54
Drop my pants. I'm like, fire me. Find the pocket. Gotta be real thorough.


Speaker 1   1:10:02
Okay.


All right. As you guys make your way to the Blue Water Inn,


Speaker 4   1:10:10
I wink it alfalfa.


Speaker 1   1:10:14
And he looks quite bewildered, and he doesn't know if he really did it, or if.


Speaker 2   1:10:19
I don't think I don't think he knows you're smuggling cocaine.


Speaker 1   1:10:24
He's a mule, isn't it? Test


Speaker 4   1:10:26
Gotta love those testies, don't you? But, uh. All right, so we, we. Straightforward. Unlike Broden, the um?


Well, I


Speaker 1   1:10:43
Mean.


Speaker 2   1:10:44
Thinking


Speaker 4   1:10:44
Of math here, I'm straighter than flagpole. Yeah,


Speaker 2   1:10:47
Wow, bully dork.


Speaker 1   1:10:50
Okay. All right, enroute to the Blue Water Inn. Oh, yes.


Speaker 4   1:10:56
Yeah, um, blue water. Keep on Rising


Speaker 2   1:11:00
Busting.


Speaker 1   1:11:02
And. Spatan and elwin. You guys have probably? At this point,


Speaker 2   1:11:11
Jesse,


Speaker 1   1:11:13
You're beginning to meet the town guards as well, Scott.


Speaker 4   1:11:17
Okay, but we can skip


Speaker 1   1:11:18
That.


Speaker 2   1:11:22
Or you can flirt with Alfalfa. I'm just gonna say if


Speaker 4   1:11:27
You had to cross his legs after seeing me.


Speaker 1   1:11:29
But


Speaker 4   1:11:29
Yeah, people saw it.


Speaker 2   1:11:31
People saw it. Oh, that's up to you. I don't mind, I don't. I don't. I don't care. Either way,


Speaker 4   1:11:36
Jeremy can join if you want.


Speaker 1   1:11:39
To be. You could be bewildered,


Speaker 4   1:11:41
Who's the silence?


Speaker 1   1:11:42
On his first day,


Speaker 4   1:11:43
A broken cock is.


Speaker 1   1:11:49
Okay. Before you all leave though, and the whole crew gets this speech from Jeremy, as Alfalfa is listening on intently. The name strawd is strictly illegal. Even in written form. Know that even now, I, as I say his name, it is the last time you will hear it within the gates. Instead, you must refer to aforementioned individual as simply the devil. Are we all in agreeance


Speaker 2   1:12:30
The dark lord as they say in Harry Potter? What is


Speaker 5   1:12:33
What's about? What's the wolf heads about?


Speaker 2   1:12:36
Is it normal?


Speaker 1   1:12:43
And alfalfa seems very, you know, eager to say? The. Looks around the devil, ascends them. The falaki is a fortress. And the devil will not come through. His minions will not come through. Oh, okay. So, it's like a scaring your enemies


Speaker 2   1:13:06
Like, okay, okay. I understand that I'm conceptual level at least. I'm not sure how the Wolves are gonna be scared though. Yeah, not that they're evil wolves, right?


Speaker 1   1:13:17
They are the devil's wolves.


Speaker 4   1:13:20
Right? Nope.


Speaker 1   1:13:21
The devil's Wolves?


Speaker 2   1:13:25
Uh-Huh. Okay, all right. That's so that's why they're on there. They're mounted on the pipes, all right. Yes, all right.


Speaker 1   1:13:31
I


Speaker 2   1:13:31
Wasn't sure if there was, like, some kind of other reason or something now.


Speaker 1   1:13:35
Don't like them. The devil's words don't like them. Okay, yes, all right.


Speaker 5   1:13:39
This is, it doesn't smell, though


Speaker 2   1:13:41
It has it's I, I could smell of weird. It smells terrible, but it's a meal if it's still fresh off.


Speaker 1   1:13:50
The smell of a locky is a welcome smell. There are no complaints for me.


Speaker 4   1:13:59
Another pet on there,


Speaker 1   1:14:01
You're doing great. Okay.


Okay, all right. Well, this weather


Speaker 4   1:14:10
That sounds nice.


Speaker 1   1:14:11
That was a. So, Jeremy keeps going on. A festival is held each week in honor. Of General merriment. And in support of the Bergen Master, Baron Vargas, balakovich.


August. Balakovich.


That's a mouthful. And no, I have hanging up Wolf's head Jamboree. All will be well. Posters and the Blazing sun, rain, or shine poster? The baron has signed off on each of them. It says on each each of the posters. It says attendance and children required.


Speaker 4   1:15:04
Don't forget, come one.


Speaker 2   1:15:06
Come on us to bring children.


Speaker 1   1:15:07
Yes,


Speaker 2   1:15:08
You don't have a child. Well, probably should be having one.


Speaker 1   1:15:17
Attendance in the festivals are absolutely mandatory.


Did I hear that right? Fail here to attend will be in strict opposition to the velocian wall law. The next great Malachian Festival, the Festival of the Blazing sun, will be held in four days time in the Town Square. We already held the Wolf's head Jamboree.


Speaker 2   1:15:46
Yeah, so we're leaving before that,


Speaker 1   1:15:47
But the Wolf's had jammed. We put Wolf's head on spikes.


Speaker 2   1:15:52
I hate parties.


Speaker 1   1:15:54
Not


Speaker 4   1:15:55
My kind of parties.


Speaker 1   1:15:56
Failure to comply with. Blocking law. Mark you as criminals. Hmm, you will be punished in accordance to our justice system.


Do you have any questions?


And alfalfa's just looking at Jeremy like?


Speaker 4   1:16:20
Why specifically children required?


Speaker 1   1:16:26
Children are required because? All must celebrate the festival. The children must learn at a young age that. All will be well as long as we. Are Mary, and as long as we? Our accordance of the law and follow the Bergen master and his wishes. The town itself will be safe. I really got


Speaker 2   1:16:59
An inside check on this guys. He's like. Giving this speech about why we have to act a certain way and do certain things


Speaker 1   1:17:05
You can roll an Insight check.


Speaker 2   1:17:08
Like, what's like, what's his like, General, like?


Speaker 4   1:17:12
You get what I'm saying, like? They're pretty polar options. How


Speaker 1   1:17:17
Are you doing? Ken, are you okay? Yeah, I'm good. Okay.


Speaker 4   1:17:22
Wake up! Oh, I didn't say that. That was, um,


Speaker 2   1:17:27
Broden, talking to Jeremy.


Speaker 4   1:17:31
So that works


Speaker 1   1:17:33
His heart's, not in it.


Speaker 2   1:17:35
His heart's not. He's just kind of like reading off, like. Yeah, the the light in his eyes is gone. Yeah, he's he's. Yeah, okay, that's about


Speaker 1   1:17:44
What you get. Okay, yeah,


Speaker 2   1:17:45
Okay. So, so this, so all this shit is also total horseshit. So he's so I can tell he's feeding me a lot of more or less total horseshoe that he doesn't actually believe.


Speaker 1   1:17:56
His heart's not in it.


Speaker 2   1:17:58
It's hard, it's not in it. Okay, so first.


Well, thank you for the information, um, Brad, we should. We should all get to the end, you guys. We're going to be late. Thank you for making the way for us. By the way, I didn't want to start on them too much. Our Frills pulse. The lizard Frills.


Speaker 4   1:18:23
I'm familiar with.


Speaker 1   1:18:26
Um. All right. So, are we all one unit, or are


Speaker 4   1:18:32
You two catching up to us?


Speaker 1   1:18:38
I believe we're catching it.


Speaker 2   1:18:40
Right, yeah, I think we're just pinching. I


Speaker 4   1:18:42
Just didn't know the distance between the two groups now. Yeah, you guys


Speaker 1   1:18:45
Probably would have made it to the the end first.


Speaker 2   1:18:51
I've always made it in. Yeah.


Speaker 1   1:18:53
And the the town itself, and you're gonna pull out what?


Speaker 2   1:18:58
Yeah,


Speaker 1   1:18:59
Nice.


Speaker 2   1:18:59
We go to the no pool out ends. Yeah, the no


Speaker 1   1:19:03
Pull out ends. That's it.


Speaker 2   1:19:09
Oh


Speaker 1   1:19:09
My least favorite man.


There every year.


I open this and I have yet


Speaker 4   1:19:26
To eat it, so I'm putting it.


Speaker 2   1:19:28
It didn't make it. I'm sorry.


Speaker 1   1:19:31
As you make your way through the town. The house is itself. It's age worn? There's not much color here. Um. The commoners and townsfolk. Avoid you all, like the plague. If you lock eyes with them, they quickly turn away and go into their houses and shut the door.


But you're as you make your way. Um,


Speaker 5   1:20:13
You


Speaker 1   1:20:14
Do notice. Blue water inside. Gray smoke issues from the chimney of this large two-story wooden building with a stone foundation. And the the roof is kind of hanging on by a thread here. Um, several Ravens are perched on the roof. A painted wooden sign hanging above the main entrance depicts a blue waterfall.


So well, this doesn't look like it was worth it. Just go back there.


Um.


Comes


Speaker 2   1:21:02
Again. I think I'm gonna sleep in the dirty tent actually.


Speaker 1   1:21:05
Are you gonna stand for this Donnie camp? Okay? Well, just making


Speaker 2   1:21:14
It aside as I stare up at the raggedy building. This place sucks.


Speaker 1   1:21:18
This is horrible. Did the tongue is just your taste in here?


Speaker 2   1:21:23
It's a smelly taste. Yeah, it's a bad taste. This tastes like. So, if the roof is hanging


Speaker 4   1:21:32
By a thread? It's shingles.


Speaker 2   1:21:34
Yeah, like, am I replaced? One of those bash roof type things, or like, really kind of


Speaker 1   1:21:45
Tiles.


Speaker 2   1:21:46
Okay, so it's the shingles, so it's the shingles. Shingles are in shambles.


Speaker 1   1:21:50
Hello, you've been waiting. Um. Well. Are we supposed to meet


Speaker 4   1:22:01
At or in? Yeah, we go in the


Speaker 1   1:22:04
Inn. Yeah, we


Speaker 2   1:22:04
Go into the end. Yeah, all right, they'll call it an out. Oh yeah, all right.


Speaker 4   1:22:09
Oh yeah, I wanted to check my.


Speaker 1   1:22:14
Are you walking into the end?


Speaker 2   1:22:24
And then a spider corpse Falls. Is there light in the end? Okay.


Speaker 1   1:22:31
As you make your way into the end, it's.


I have a map for it, but we're not even using them. We're not even looking at these Maps are we? Uh, not looking at it. I,


Speaker 2   1:22:43
I look at whatever you put in front of me. Okay,


Speaker 4   1:22:45
On the Discord, get it right now in Discord. Hannah, no,


Speaker 1   1:22:50
I didn't post it in Discord because


Speaker 4   1:22:52
I had to do a screenshot of it, um.


Speaker 1   1:22:56
I could have sworn there


Speaker 4   1:22:57
Or something posted.


Speaker 1   1:22:57
There's a lot posted in the Discord like NPCs,


Speaker 4   1:23:01
Um.


Speaker 1   1:23:03
Oh, but Hannah, this map is just like a standard bar. Next time I will, I'm sorry I had. I tried to set it up this session. But I'll have like a virtual map for you next session. Um,


Speaker 2   1:23:18
That's just like


Speaker 1   1:23:20
A nice reference pictures for it.


Speaker 4   1:23:23
Gotcha, but


Speaker 1   1:23:25

Speaker 1   1:34:04
No, it's just solid beets.


Speaker 2   1:34:06
It's just it's just go. It's probably


Speaker 1   1:34:08
It's


Speaker 2   1:34:09
Nice. It's straight, peasant food. It could probably use some more spice or salt, or literally anything other than but it's it's, but it has beef. Yeah,


Speaker 1   1:34:16
Yeah,


Speaker 4   1:34:17
Sustenance. Let's go, I. About where this beat was. Beat dude, all right, so food criticism. Yeah, I don't know what utensils, but I'm like down in this thing. It's getting Warrior. I'm just drinking


Speaker 2   1:34:37
Out of the bowl.


Speaker 4   1:34:37

Speaker 2   1:34:44
It's


Speaker 1   1:34:46
Been in the end for several minutes and as. At the bar, drinking your beet soup. Um, you see two boys. At a table. They're at closer look. They look to be barely over 20. And then. You see a man? Sitting at a table by himself.


Speaker 2   1:35:10
He's


Speaker 1   1:35:11
Dressed in very colorful clothes and has a loot over his back.


And that is all you see in the end right now.

Don't see Karina. Does anybody else here see Arena? She's not that guy, right? No, she's


Speaker 4   1:35:30
Not that

Guy.


Speaker 4   1:35:32
I'm pretty interested in what I see,


Speaker 2   1:35:34
I suppose. I could always ask, and I've been wrong before. But that's certainly not her, unless she's in an exceptional disguise.


Speaker 1   1:35:49
Got a


Speaker 2   1:35:50
Little more time. What time is it? Is there some way to tell time? It's like

Everything is beetsu.


Speaker 2   1:36:33

Speaker 4   1:47:34
Him doing him.


Speaker 1   1:47:37
I'd like you to just do a perception check.


Speaker 4   1:47:42
Oh yeah, okay


Speaker 1   1:47:43
On this guy.


Speaker 4   1:47:46
All right.


Trying to get a sound bite for


Speaker 2   1:47:52
This? Fucking ads all over YouTube now, oh!


Speaker 1   1:47:56
Oh my God, I forgot to put on the music. That's okay, I guess we can't hear it anyway.


Speaker 4   1:48:05
Honestly, my stuff not showing up. I got on 11.


Speaker 1   1:48:08
Okay. Just seems like. An odd dude. Colorful. Poorly, playing the loot.


Speaker 2   1:48:18
The worst part I've ever heard? Yeah, terrible at it. Well, thank


Speaker 1   1:48:23
You, friend. I appreciate you bringing me this Mighty beet soup well.


Speaker 4   1:48:32
Things go well.


Speaker 2   1:48:35
Three of your Mighty meat soup later.


Speaker 4   1:48:39
That's pretty good.


Speaker 1   1:48:41
He blush is so intensely.


Speaker 2   1:48:46
That's pretty good. Yeah, how old's Broden?


Speaker 4   1:48:54
For a dwarf, you know, he's


Speaker 2   1:48:56
Worse, mature at about the same rate as humans, I think, but they live a lot longer.


Speaker 1   1:49:00
Yeah,


Speaker 2   1:49:00
Like they're adults around the same age as like humans are, but? They live to be like three or four hundred.


Speaker 4   1:49:07
Oh nice, yeah, but um.


Broden's on, like, for an average human scale.


Speaker 3   1:49:18
A


Speaker 4   1:49:18
Little more than middle-aged,


Speaker 2   1:49:20
So I want 150 or so.


Speaker 4   1:49:22
Yeah, I'd say so. You know enough that you know you spit around several blocks? Oh yeah,


Speaker 2   1:49:28
He's


Speaker 1   1:49:29
Banged


Speaker 2   1:49:29
Around the block. Yeah,


Speaker 4   1:49:30
If there's, you know, there's North Manor. But there's dwarf Diner, yeah? Dwarf daddies.


Speaker 2   1:49:39
I like it. I'm very encouraging of it.


Speaker 4   1:49:45
Um,


Speaker 2   1:49:46
God. I love to work Chinese. Oh yeah, I thought it was milk


Speaker 1   1:49:50
Retavio looks.


Speaker 2   1:49:52
No, that's. That's next door.


Speaker 1   1:49:54
He seems to be in his 40s. It does seem like he's trying to appear younger.


Well.


What brings you to? The beautiful Village of Allah.


Speaker 4   1:50:17
Well, me and my lot. Trying to meet up with old friends?


Speaker 1   1:50:23
You're a lot. Are you adventurers?


Speaker 4   1:50:28
Quite the same


Speaker 2   1:50:28
That would Park up in nods. Yes, I'm not from around here.


Speaker 1   1:50:33
He's sitting with rictabio at a table, and


Speaker 2   1:50:35
You're at a bar. Would you join him? Is that how, I mean, there's nobody else in here, right? No,


Speaker 1   1:50:40
I, as I said there was, um, there's two kids playing with the elements dog. And then there's the Walker Brothers that are.


Over 20 years old.


Speaker 2   1:50:57
Oh, oh, okay. So, when I heard kids, I was picturing them really like, scrap, like scrapping young men. No,


Speaker 1   1:51:03
There. I said they're a little over barely over 20 okay, but


Speaker 2   1:51:07
They're


Speaker 1   1:51:07
The Walker Brothers enjoying a nice picture of wine. Worktavio, sitting by himself and then you all.


Speaker 2   1:51:15
But nah, not particularly close to the bar. And probably once. I, once I saw Broden like chatting him up a little bit, I might. I probably would go over too, if only because I, I have that particularly any interest in meeting this random woman who I haven't been given up here to a good reason to care about other than clearly important to those, you know, these people. But, you know, now, this guy, though, he's got a weird hat. About. Right?


Speaker 1   1:51:42
Yeah, because yeah,


Speaker 2   1:51:43
Yeah. Yeah, no, we are, we are. We are adventurous, although I only just met these folk.


Speaker 1   1:51:51
Well, uh, we're we are all strangers in some sense. Right, true?


How long have you been in the village? With launch.


Speaker 4   1:52:07
Not enough to spot you from afar.


Speaker 7   1:52:11
He's getting it. This is so getting it right now.


Speaker 1   1:52:17
Quite flattered. I'm a little over your. Around the same age, maybe?


Well, I I'm a musician myself.


Came into the village to see it need to jump. Followed my heart here. Not much Joy has been spread, but I, I'll keep at it.


Speaker 2   1:52:49
It seems pretty


Speaker 4   1:52:51
Dreary here.


Speaker 1   1:52:53
Yes. It. But if there's music to be had, there's fun to be had. And,


Speaker 4   1:53:01
Oh yes. Are you from borrovia too? No?


Speaker 1   1:53:06
I'm not


Speaker 2   1:53:07
So. You also wandered into that terrible list.


Speaker 1   1:53:13
Is it terrible or did it lead me to my destiny?


Speaker 2   1:53:19
Can't do attitudes. It seems quite terrible, actually.


Speaker 1   1:53:25
Yeah, no, I would like


Speaker 2   1:53:26
To go home but same. See all signs points that I could ask


Speaker 1   1:53:30
You're home. Where's your well?


Speaker 2   1:53:34
Are you telling


Speaker 4   1:53:35
Me you have a room I'd like to at least? I would like to want these people to see the room.


Speaker 2   1:53:45
I would like stroke, my, like, oh.


Speaker 1   1:53:48
How you're religious?


Speaker 2   1:53:51
I have a cleric of Saloon.


Speaker 1   1:53:53
Good for you. And these Strokes, his chest. It's completely buried, doesn't have anything.


Speaker 2   1:53:58
Oh wow, okay. Got an open shirt, yeah? Unrelated. I can't be wooed by you.


Speaker 4   1:54:09
Um, I'm sorry, I'm just getting mine.


Speaker 7   1:54:13
Line from the end, which is dangerously low in wine.


Speaker 1   1:54:16
Yes,


Speaker 2   1:54:16
Well, we're not, it's not running out while we hear.


Speaker 4   1:54:20
Drier than Trent?


Speaker 2   1:54:23
Get the Trent wine going Trent themed wine. The big one. It's mostly not.


Speaker 1   1:54:32
I came through the Mist with my assistant. He, I'm sorry, Edward, you're not part of the conversation. Um, I came through the Mist with my assistant, but he went missing quite. Quite quickly, uh? Dangerous. But you seem a capable lot.


Speaker 4   1:54:57
Oh, quite, great!


Quite capable of a lot of things. If you want to, uh, figure that out, but what? What happened to your assistant? How did he go?


Speaker 1   1:55:13
Quite suddenly. He was beside me, and then all at once he was gone.


Well, it was. Awful, he vanished. Very quickly, as if he hadn't been there at all.


Speaker 4   1:55:31
Well, in notes of passion myself, I've seen quite a few do the same, you know? Morning after? They call it a one-night stand, but if it's a good night, you're not standing there, but? Ah, wow.


Speaker 1   1:55:48
And it as you're talking. Broden, he's looking at your armor. You a soldier,


Speaker 4   1:55:56
Dip some my hand, my beads. Oh, did he ask him, I soldier?


Speaker 1   1:56:03
Are you a soldier?


You can say it. So, of my people


Speaker 4   1:56:17
Of the mountain people? This Crest on. Chest sweating beating, oh


Speaker 2   1:56:25
Yeah, you know,


Speaker 4   1:56:26
Letting them see it, but not really point to the crest more of my chest. We are proud people.


Speaker 1   1:56:36
Katan, you've been sitting for quite a while. Can you do a perception check on this guy? Sure.


Speaker 2   1:56:43
What's the old man over? Let's see. See if


Speaker 4   1:56:50
They're gonna pick anything up about him, you ask if I'm a soldier? Are you looking for a strong book?


Speaker 2   1:56:59
16.


Speaker 1   1:57:00
That's 16 16.


His, his appearances in order, but? Doesn't quite seem authentic, but you can't pick apart any specific detail. Yeah, but it just seems it seems


Speaker 2   1:57:28
Like he's wearing a costume a


Speaker 1   1:57:30
Little bit,


Speaker 2   1:57:31
Uh.


Okay, no real. Boys clearly terrible.


Speaker 1   1:57:38
But


Speaker 4   1:57:40
Enough about us.


Speaker 1   1:57:42
As you guys are talking,


Speaker 4   1:57:42
Yeah,


Speaker 1   1:57:43
The door opens. And. Figure with a hood over their head. Enters the. Um. They look around, put the hood down. And you see Irena walking? Through the end, her steps are very slow. Um, and she's got her cloak wrapped tightly around her. And she catches you quite quickly Edward and just sits right next to you at the bar.


Speaker 2   1:58:20
Just don't even think you wouldn't show up.


Speaker 1   1:58:25
She turns to you, and um. She's got a gash right through her face,


Speaker 4   1:58:33
Um.


Speaker 1   1:58:34
Fresh. Not have time. She did not have time to heal. Her hair is dirty. Is she? Irena is. Prideful individual. She's always been very clean and. She's never let you see her. You know without her best self present and she's very disheveled.


And she clocks Irwin. Shooting odd at him, and he kind of goes away. He seems familiar with her and gives you to some privacy.


But,


Speaker 2   1:59:16
I guess, like, I'll give her.


Speaker 4   1:59:22
What? It's Jesus Christ.


Speaker 7   1:59:27
Like, oh yeah.


Speaker 4   1:59:30
You can call this place Broden's Pizza. And who? I will,


Speaker 1   1:59:35
And who is your friend? And she looks at you, Ellen.


Ellen. Yeah, bitch.


Speaker 2   1:59:47
Call me Steve o.


Speaker 1   1:59:55
Apologies.


Speaker 2   1:59:56
Tired


Speaker 1   1:59:57
And? It's been some years. But. You came. I wrote a letter and you came, and I. Appreciate it. I'm sorry, I'm rambling.


We, we can talk here.


Speaker 2   2:00:19
Can I give her part of the cookie? That I have


Speaker 1   2:00:24
Sure. You can give her parties a cookie. Damn sorry!


Speaker 2   2:00:29
Where do you look Dreadful after this encounter and I do want you to know that I? And interested in in knowing what we can do for you. But in the meantime, there's a medicinal cooking,


Speaker 4   2:00:41
Oh help.


Speaker 1   2:00:45
I appreciate the snap.


Speaker 2   2:00:48
No, it's medicine.


Speaker 1   2:00:52
Thank you. How are you both? Um.


Speaker 2   2:01:00
Confused and without why?


Speaker 1   2:01:04
Yes, this, they served one. You can get my.


Speaker 5   2:01:08

Speaker 2   2:01:08
Turns out there's a bit of a shortage.


Speaker 1   2:01:10
There's a short, but you can still get it.


Speaker 2   2:01:14
How are you? Is the real question?


Speaker 1   2:01:18
I've been better, I.


I like to talk. And I believe we are able to do so. Every now and then, you may have. I may cut into your head.


Speaker 2   2:01:37
Ah, the messages. Yes.


Speaker 1   2:01:40
So? Every now and then, she might do that okay. And she'll tell you.


Speaker 2   2:01:48
Um. Matthew


Speaker 1   2:01:50
Is in the village and he's safe.


Speaker 4   2:01:53
We're gonna have a great time at the end.


Speaker 2   2:01:54
Oh, I


Speaker 1   2:01:56
Can't tell you his location, and that's all she tells you about Matthew.


Speaker 2   2:02:03
Smith is here, I did. He was here with you last. Kind of classic.


Speaker 1   2:02:19
I'm sorry. I've tried. She looks at Eloin and. Tries to look abroad, and broden seems quite interesting


Speaker 2   2:02:28
In this fake Bard.


Speaker 1   2:02:32
I,


Speaker 2   2:02:34
This is great. It was great.


Speaker 1   2:02:38
I've dragged you into an awful mess. And there is no way out, but through it. I don't know what


Speaker 2   2:02:50
You've dragged us into. Aside from the fortune teller who is essentially asked us to slay the? Devil. Of this land.


Speaker 1   2:03:08
And every now and then, just remember she's saying some things in your head. Okay. Ellen, she'll be saying some things in your head to. Um.


Matthew.


Gotten a little over his head and? Flirted with death.


Try to come and rescue him.


Speaker 2   2:03:44
Here


Speaker 1   2:03:44
I am. Seven months later. Give or take? Not much closer. To getting him back.


And she's not going. She's reluctant to say his name, but she does it strawd. Would like to make him a husband? Broken.


Speaker 4   2:04:17
Wait, am I hearing this or I'm

We haven't even been to the church I.


Speaker 2   2:05:20
Of a few places that we've. Talked about in the campaign. So far, yes, I'd been there in a mini run.

Okay,

Once was a lad who'd sang of and eats out of tune. Fixes it. The once was a liar. And then hang on. I got it. He's a very poor player of the loot.


Speaker 2   2:06:20
He's a very special man.

Let's hope you're better at other things.


Speaker 2   2:06:29

Yeah, Saint.


Speaker 2   2:06:36
Andrews yeah, that sounds about right, yes?


Speaker 1   2:06:42
Don't go to church more of a free spirit myself.


Speaker 2   2:06:45
It seems to the kind of place that's very into their church. Yes.


Speaker 1   2:06:50
But.


It ain't me.


Speaker 2   2:06:55
About about that.


Speaker 1   2:06:58
No, it's. It's a,


Speaker 2   2:07:00
It's a big building.


Speaker 1   2:07:02
Not far from here.


West on the road, take you to the church if you wish to go to it.


Speaker 2   2:07:19
No, perhaps I'll pay my respects. Morning Lord is. Just got an ally of Saloon.


Speaker 1   2:07:30
Yes.


Speaker 2   2:07:37
Interesting


Speaker 1   2:07:38
Folk. Gods folk. Yes.


Speaker 2   2:07:45
Are you? Okay, yeah. Yesterday.


Speaker 1   2:07:54
Careful,


Speaker 4   2:07:55
Um, you only got two of those.


Speaker 8   2:07:56
Yeah,


Speaker 4   2:07:56
This is a changing character from his overly optimism. It doesn't seem to, like, yeah,


Speaker 2   2:08:06
Um, it's fine.


Speaker 1   2:08:08
That's okay.


Speaker 2   2:08:09
We don't have to be friends well. You know, lovers


Speaker 4   2:08:13
In the night aren't supposed to really see much, but?


Overall performance later, but. It's performance.


Speaker 2   2:08:23
Oh, it's not Athletics fuck. Oh yeah. He's feigning it.


Speaker 4   2:08:30
Wow, um. Now, you're going to tell me sleight of hand isn't what I think it is. It's


Speaker 2   2:08:35
Soft the whole time.


Speaker 1   2:08:38
My God, that's so fun.


Speaker 2   2:08:38
He's pushing well.


Speaker 4   2:08:43
How long has it? Well, sorry, I was asking the wrong voice to


Speaker 2   2:08:47
The right. Actually. Another thing, I think it'd be acrobat.


Speaker 4   2:08:53
How long has he stayed? In the end, some results, I think.


Speaker 1   2:08:59
Um.


A couple of. A couple of years now.


Speaker 4   2:09:13
And how long ago did he lose his assistant?


Speaker 2   2:09:19
A


Speaker 1   2:09:19
Couple of years.


Speaker 2   2:09:21
Oh, so when you first got, yeah, going to the Mist, I think. He said he, like, looked back, and the assistant screamed, and he was never gone.


Speaker 4   2:09:39
And. Instead of doing something like myself, you?


Clearly haven't improved your music skills. So what, what else have you been doing other than Sheridan Beach with? Brawny and, uh,


Speaker 2   2:10:00
Delicious.


Speaker 1   2:10:01
I do. I am a jack of all trades. I entertain the mask. Quite a puppeteer! Quite skilled with balloon handling, but not many balloons to be found here. Um. Good with horses.


Speaker 4   2:10:24
You know, horses, not the horse, but? We just came across. Oh, fuck, her name. Yes. Uh, not in that voice, but? What was she doing? She was just seeing the horses she was seeing the horses because they're sad here. Yeah.


Speaker 2   2:10:45
Sad horses. We were


Speaker 4   2:10:51
Just dealing with someone interested in the horses


Speaker 2   2:10:54
Or sad these horses.


Speaker 1   2:10:57
I've noticed a girl who hangs around the end.


Visits the livestock and stuff. It's nice girl. Give some apples some cash. Don't know where she gets the app?


Speaker 2   2:11:16
Did you happen to see anything


Speaker 4   2:11:21
Recently said past night? About a man. Doing anything. Asking about, um, what's his name? The blue, something blue, blue, well, blue toe blue. The guy that was, uh, put to death by. Are sent to be killed. Oh, how


Speaker 1   2:11:52
Are you asking this question again?


Speaker 4   2:11:55
Um. If he happened to see a strange drunkard,


Speaker 1   2:11:59
A strange drunk. That would be blue toe.


Speaker 2   2:12:05
That's right,


Speaker 1   2:12:06
He's wanted for mooning the Bergen Master Burger


Speaker 4   2:12:10
Master Master supposed to


Speaker 1   2:12:12
Be put to he's behind. Aimed. For mooning,


Speaker 2   2:12:17
You must be repeating


Speaker 1   2:12:19
During the festival of the Wolf's head, Jamboo. Oh


Speaker 2   2:12:23
Well. They won't be doing that. This was all of what, like, an hour. It was an important best,


Speaker 4   2:12:31
Um.


Speaker 1   2:12:32
Hannah, how are you doing? I'm sorry. All right, okay?


Speaker 4   2:12:37
Are you on your bed?


Speaker 1   2:12:39
Yes, okay.


Speaker 4   2:12:40
I've been looking at. Brooksavio, um.


Um,


Speaker 1   2:12:54
Going back to Irena and alwyn. And Edward, yes.


I'd. Ticket Matthew. In the church. It's sacred ground. However, there's some complications.


The church is not well.


The bones. That. Blessed have been removed.


From underneath the church. So it's been desecrated. So,


Speaker 2   2:13:49
The charge isn't. Bless grounds in its current state.


Speaker 1   2:13:53
Yes, okay.


Speaker 2   2:13:56
But who took the bones? I


Speaker 1   2:13:58
Don't know.


Speaker 2   2:13:59
The bones are missing sacred bones.


Speaker 1   2:14:01
Yes, okay.


Speaker 2   2:14:06
Trick secret bones.


Speaker 1   2:14:08
The people here. Believe that. He will not come here. But that? This is a lot he could come here whenever he'd like. This is borobia. This is his lab. But sacred ground is sacred ground and.


The vampire.


Speaker 2   2:14:44
Hmm. So, we have to reclaim the bounds, make round sacred, then Matthew can be safe with in the church for the time being. Well, weed destroy the man himself.


I don't know if that's possible.


Speaker 1   2:15:07
I've been here a long time and.


Not long in his years, but He is very strong. As of right now, and while you Edward and you alawynne are? Very capable.


Do not believe. You are strong enough for him, and I say this, as someone who has. Seen him.


His pretension.


Speaker 2   2:15:47
I suppose we won't now until we've completed the prophecy. First shot. I think to think that everything would pay off and. We'll get this mess sorted out and over with. Matthew will go back to living in normal life.


Speaker 1   2:16:16
Would be nice, and it would be more than. I could dream up. Again, I'm sorry for dragging you into this mess until he looks at you and elwin and looks at Broden with nothing. She's like, okay.


Speaker 2   2:16:36
Well, it's. It's always


Speaker 1   2:16:39
Had an open heart, just like my brother and.


Speaker 4   2:16:43
In my yellow man.


Speaker 1   2:16:45
I


Speaker 2   2:16:46
Don't fault him


Speaker 1   2:16:49
For that, sir. Okay, how are you guys feeling? Are we too? Are we tired now? Do we want to close the session? No? Okay, Hannah, how are you feeling? I'm getting pretty tired. Okay, all right. How about we close it off soon? Um.


Speaker 2   2:17:12
And


Speaker 1   2:17:13
We


Speaker 2   2:17:13
Fill the Walker boys and fillet them.


Speaker 1   2:17:16
You can't talk to the locker boys yet. By the way, that's


Speaker 4   2:17:18
True.


Speaker 1   2:17:19
I did introduce them, but they're just sitting there.


Speaker 2   2:17:21
We wear their skin. That that's not. So, being serious is loading, right? No, actually, David, oh, okay, all right, because I was gonna say, I don't think they'll fit me. Guys, I don't think this is gonna work now.


Speaker 4   2:17:39
I don't know if it's the beat talking now, um? Yeah, I mean this guy's. He could be packing, but he's also, you know,


Speaker 2   2:17:50
He's in the beach well.


Wow, that's delicious beet soup.


Speaker 1   2:18:02
He rectavio turns to Edward and. L1, and he keeps looking back at them. You all are together.


Speaker 2   2:18:12
Yes, well.


Speaker 4   2:18:17
Yes,


Speaker 1   2:18:17
An adventuring party.


Speaker 2   2:18:20
Yes, of a sort of a sort circumstances brought us together. Fresh eggs or scrubs.


Speaker 1   2:18:30
Can, I'm sorry, you're so tired. Well, we'll just, we'll close it out here. No, no, no, we'll close out here. This is,


Speaker 2   2:18:39
This is as good at times. I need to stop.


Speaker 1   2:18:40
We're at the Blue Water Inn


Speaker 2   2:18:42
At the Blue Water Boost. We're getting


Speaker 1   2:18:44
Several quests lined up.


Speaker 2   2:18:47
We're getting some idea of our bearings. Absolutely! All right, these are tapio guy. Seems like he's a cool


Speaker 9   2:18:54
Guy. He's a terrible bar, though I hope he's good


Speaker 2   2:18:57
At something I


Speaker 4   2:18:58
Couldn't find. This


Speaker 2   2:19:00
Sure is, so I was, it was a layout, but he didn't even take it. No, what? He said he was a cool guy. I hope he's good at something. Ah


Speaker 4   2:19:08
Well, yeah, I hope so too, you know? And walk all this way. For not blue water. I'm getting blue balls right now.


Speaker 2   2:19:19
Um, now they're red.


Speaker 4   2:19:24
Um. Well, I guess it's not worth asking the question. I'll save my question


Speaker 2   2:19:30
The next area.


Speaker 4   2:19:30
I didn't, so I didn't hear the conversation that Irena said, right?


Speaker 1   2:19:34
No,


Speaker 2   2:19:34
The conversation. Yeah, I assume, like,


Speaker 1   2:19:37
They would probably relate to.


Speaker 2   2:19:39
Well, we're going to have a coming together party.


Speaker 4   2:19:41
Oh, okay, you know, because I have some, like


Speaker 2   2:19:43
Her name. Up to the party.


Speaker 4   2:19:47
I have an assumption due to actual like history.


Speaker 1   2:19:49
Okay, so there's.


Speaker 2   2:19:52
And then I got red balls gonna write that down from four Jesse. You're only doing this. Yeah. I don't think I am all right. God, that's cool.


Speaker 1   2:20:02
Thank you all for a wonderful session. This was our third session, amazing


Speaker 2   2:20:07
Gang gang,


Speaker 1   2:20:09
Um, we're really making our way downtown. Yeah,


Speaker 2   2:20:12
As it were


Speaker 4   2:20:14
Walking fast,


Speaker 1   2:20:16
This isn't gonna be it. I do want to say that. I don't think anyone is thinking this, well, we are not killing strawd and borobia. We're not killing straw here in next session. This will take away. The long run, you're telling me


Speaker 2   2:20:34
A level four party can't kill straw.


Speaker 4   2:20:36
Hey, I'm sorry,


Speaker 1   2:20:36
I'm just. I just want us to gear up. I just want us to get into it mentally


Speaker 4   2:20:40
As Broden knows the best sessions.


Speaker 2   2:20:46
And eventually, Hannah will be here in person. Try, let me fill this up. Fight level four party, all right, amazing. All right,


Speaker 5   2:20:57
Fantastic. He wouldn't


Speaker 2   2:20:59
Even take a complete action to kill him. No, he would kill us with wife, whatever. Why is it every time he was just every session so far? Yeah,


Speaker 5   2:21:10
Uh, you already got this. Yeah, it? They passed funding. That's all it is. It.


Speaker 2   2:21:15
Wow, okay, it hasn't even gone. So, Congress has passed the legislation.
