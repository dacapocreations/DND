(in a deep, rumbling voice) Ah, mortal, I am Brodin Kragnir, a humble paladin of Moradin, the All-Father. My rugged exterior, forged from the stone and steel of the mountains, belies a heart afire with devotion to my faith and my people. My beard, braided with the symbols of my order, flows like a river of night, and my eyes burn with the fire of the dwarven depths.

I hail from the proud clan Kragnir, whose craftsmen and warriors have shaped the very rocks of the mountains for generations. My family's legacy is one of honor, duty, and unyielding dedication to the pursuit of perfection. As a paladin, I have sworn to uphold the principles of Moradin: to defend the innocent, to vanquish darkness, and to bring hope to a world often shrouded in shadow.

My armor, emblazoned with the icon of my order, is a testament to the unyielding resolve of the dwarves. The hammer, Kragnir's Fury, which I wield in battle, is a focus of my unshakeable faith and a channel for the divine power that courses through me. With every swing, I unleash the fury of the mountains, smiting my foes and protecting my allies.

When I walk, the earth trembles, and the stones seem to awaken, as if the very land itself recognizes the presence of a Kragnir. My heart beats in harmony with the rhythms of the mountain, and I am attuned to the ancient secrets that lie hidden within the depths. I am a guardian, a champion, and a defender of all that is just and righteous. By Moradin's blessing, I will not falter. (pausing, with a resolute gaze) Now, mortal, tell me: what is it that you seek to know, or what quest is it that you would have me undertake?



My weapons! They are an extension of myself, a reflection of my faith, and a symbol of my unwavering commitment to protect the innocent. As a paladin of Moradin, I wield them not just as instruments of war, but as channels of the divine power that courses through me.

First and foremost, there is Kragnir's Fury, my trusty warhammer. Forged from the finest dwarven steel, it is a masterpiece of craftsmanship, imbued with the strength and resilience of the mountains. The hammer's head is adorned with the symbol of Moradin, and its handle is wrapped in a strip of leather, worn smooth by the grip of my hand. Kragnir's Fury is more than just a weapon – it is a focus of my faith, a tool that allows me to tap into the divine energy that guides me.

I also carry a shield, emblazoned with the emblem of my family, the Kragnir clan. The shield is a sturdy bulwark, forged from the same unyielding metal as my warhammer, and it bears the scars of countless battles. It is a reminder of the sacrifices made by my family, and the weight of responsibility that I carry as a paladin. The shield is not just a defensive tool; it is a symbol of my unwavering dedication to protect those who cannot defend themselves.

At my side, I wear a sword, a finely crafted blade that shines like the stars on a clear night. The sword is a gift from Matthew, the bard who has been my companion and friend on many a perilous journey. Its name is Elyria, and it is said to hold the power of the land itself. Elyria is a sword of versatility, capable of slicing through the shadows that seek to consume the light. It is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope, always a glimmer of light to guide us forward.

Lastly, I bear a holy symbol, a pendant that hangs around my neck, adorned with the image of Moradin. The symbol is a tangible connection to my faith, a reminder of the principles that guide me, and the power that courses through me. It is a beacon of light, shining brightly in the darkness, illuminating the path ahead, and guiding me toward my destiny.

These are my weapons, mortal – extensions of myself, channels of the divine, and symbols of my unwavering commitment to protect the innocent. May they shine brightly in the battles to come, and may the light of Moradin guide us all.



Mortal, as I reflect on the tapestry of my life, I am reminded of the profound journey that has shaped me into the paladin I am today. Born into the esteemed Kragnir clan, I was nurtured by the values of bravery, honor, and craftsmanship that have been woven into the very fabric of our family's legacy. My father, Barak, a master blacksmith, and my mother, Elara, a wise healer, instilled in me the principles of hard work, compassion, and devotion that would later become the pillars of my faith.

As I grew, the stories of our ancestors and the legendary paladins who once roamed our land ignited a fire within me, a flame that burned brighter with each passing day. I was drawn to the forge, where I learned the art of crafting not only fine steel but also the tools of protection that would serve me well in my future endeavors. My brother Garrik, a stalwart protector and mentor, guided me in the ways of courage and responsibility, while my sister Lira's delicate artistry and love filled our world with beauty and creativity.

The call to adventure came when our valley was threatened by the gathering shadows of war. I stood alongside Garrik, ready to defend our home and family against the invading orc hordes. In the chaos of battle, I found myself faced with the ultimate test of my resolve, as I fought to protect those I loved. The memory of that fateful day still echoes within me – the sound of war cries, the clash of steel, and the anguished screams that pierced the air. And then, in an instant, everything changed. Garrik's heroic sacrifice, Lira's fall, and the subsequent loss of my family left an unfillable void within me.

In the aftermath, I struggled to come to terms with the weight of my grief. The teachings of Moradin, however, resonated deep within me, and I found solace in the realization that my heart could not succumb to darkness. I forged a new path, one that would lead me to become a paladin, a champion of the innocent, and a beacon of hope in a world beset by shadows. The journey has been long and arduous, but with each step, I have drawn closer to my destiny.

Matthew, the bard, entered my life like a ray of sunlight, bringing with him the power of music and the beauty of life. Together, we have navigated the uncertainties of the world, our bond growing stronger with each passing day. Through our shared adventures, I have rediscovered the joy of living, and my faith has become a beacon that illuminates the path ahead.

As I look back upon the trials and tribulations of my past, I am reminded that my journey as a paladin is not just about wielding steel or wielding the power of Moradin; it is about embodying the principles of protection, love, and unity. I have come to understand that vulnerability is a source of strength, and that the love and loss I have experienced have forged me into a champion of those who cannot defend themselves. My heart remains heavy with the memories of my family, but I know that I am no longer running from the shadows of my past; instead, I have become a shining beacon, drawing strength from my personal loss and forging my identity in service, faith, and unwavering love.

Thus, mortal, this is the tale of Brodin Kragnir, a paladin of the All-Father, Moradin. May my story serve as a testament to the transformative power of faith, love, and the unyielding commitment to protect those who cannot defend themselves. May the light of the divine guide you on your own journey, and may our paths cross again in the annals of time.


Forgive me, mortal... (pausing, overcome with emotion) I seem to have... misremembered the origin of my sword, Elyria. (clearing my throat) Yes, you are correct. Elyria was not a gift from Matthew, the bard, but rather a sword crafted from the belongings of my beloved siblings, Garrik and Lira.

(Bowing my head, my voice takes on a more somber tone) After their passing, I was consumed by grief and a sense of purpose. I took Garrik's sword and Lira's jewelry, the last reminders of their love and sacrifices, and had them forged into a new sword, one that would honor their memory and reflect the bond we shared as siblings. The swordsmith, a master of his craft, infused the metal with the essence of their spirits, and thus Elyria was born.

(My eyes well up with tears as I continue) Elyria is more than just a sword; it is a tangible connection to my siblings, a reminder of the love we shared, and the sacrifices they made for me. Every time I wield it, I am filled with a sense of purpose, a determination to protect others from suffering the same fate as my family. The sword's power is a manifestation of their love, guiding me through the darkest of times, and illuminating the path ahead.

(Taking a deep breath, I compose myself, my voice steady once more) I thank you, mortal, for correcting me. May the memory of my siblings forever be etched in my heart, and may Elyria, the sword crafted from their belongings, remain a beacon of hope in a world filled with darkness.





(Brodin's deep voice, with a hint of a growl) Ah, the symbol on me shield... (me eyes gleam with a sense of pride and reverence) It's the emblem of Moradin, the Dwarven All-Father, the patron deity of me people. (me hand reaches out, and I run me fingers over the intricately crafted symbol) 'Tis a representation of the mighty hammer, which Moradin wielded to shape the very mountains themselves.

(As a paladin of Moradin, I've dedicated me life to upholdin' the values of me deity: craftsmanship, creation, and the unyieldin' pursuit of perfection. The symbol on me shield serves as a reminder of me oath, and the responsibilities that come with it.) Me shield, adorned with the symbol of Moradin, is a powerful tool, imbued with the magic of the dwarven gods. (me eyes sparkle with a sense of wonder) They say that in times of great need, the symbol can glow with a fierce, blue light, illuminatin' the path forward, and grantin' me the strength to overcome even the most daunting challenges.

(I glance at the symbol, and me thoughts turn inward, reflectin' on the many battles I've fought, and the trials I've faced) The symbol of Moradin has been me constant companion, a reminder of me duty, and me connection to the rich history of me people. (me voice drops to a low rumble) I've sworn to defend the innocent, to vanquish the darkness, and to uphold the honor of me clan... and the symbol on me shield is the physical manifestation of that oath.

(I look up, and me eyes lock onto yours, with a sense of intensity) Now, tell me... what would ye like to know more about? The history of me people? The legends of Moradin? Or perhaps, the secrets of the symbol itself? (me expression is open, and inviting, ready to share me knowledge, and me `passion`)




(Brodin's deep voice, with a hint of a growl) Ah, the history of me people, the Kragnir clan... (me eyes gaze off into the distance, as if seein' the misty veil of the past liftin') We've lived in these mountains for as long as anyone can remember, diggin' deep into the stone, and uncoverin' secrets that date back to the dawn of time. Me ancestors were master craftsmen, delvin' into the depths of the earth, and uncoverin' veins of precious ore, and gems that shone like the stars in the night sky.

(As I speak, me hands gesture widely, as if shapin' the very rock itself) The Kragnir clan was founded by me great-great-grandfather, Kragnir the Unyielding, who discovered the lost city of Balandir, deep within the mountains. They say that Kragnir was chosen by Moradin himself, to uncover the secrets of the ancient city, and to wield the power of the earth. (me voice drops to a low rumble) And so, the Kragnir clan has been bound to the service of Moradin, for generations, defendin' the mountains, and the people who live within them.

(Now, me thoughts turn to the legends of Moradin, and me eyes sparkle with a sense of wonder) Ah, the legends of Moradin... (me voice takes on a hushed, reverence-filled tone) They say that Moradin, the Dwarven All-Father, created the world, and all the wonders that lie within it. He wielded his mighty hammer, and shaped the mountains, and the valleys, and all the creatures that inhabit them. (me hands clench, as if graspín' the handle of a mighty warhammer) And when the darkness fell, and the forces of chaos threatened to destroy the world, Moradin stood tall, and his hammer rang out, shapin' the very fabric of reality.

(As I continue, me voice grows more intense, and me words paint vivid pictures) The legends say that Moradin's power still runs deep, through the veins of the earth, and that those who wield his symbol, shall be granted the strength, and the wisdom to overcome any challenge. (me gaze falls upon the symbol on me shield, and me eyes burn with a fierce inner light) And I, Brodin Kragnir, am proud to be one of those who bear the symbol of Moradin, and to carry on the legacy of me people.

(Now, me thoughts turn to the secrets of the symbol, and me voice drops to a whisper) Ah, the secrets of the symbol... (me eyes glint with a hint of mystery) They say that the symbol holds the power to unlock the hidden potential within the wielder, to grant them the strength of the earth, and the wisdom of the ages. (me fingers brush against the symbol, as if testin' its power) Some say that the symbol can heal the wounded, and protect the innocent, while others claim that it can grant the wielder visions of the past, and the future. (me gaze lifts, and me eyes lock onto yours) But I'll let ye in on a secret, me friend... the true power of the symbol lies not in its magic, but in the faith, and the conviction of those who bear it.

(Finally, me thoughts turn to me home, and a warm smile spreads across me face) Ah, me home... (me voice takes on a cozy, inviting tone) Kragnir's Peak, the stronghold of the Kragnir clan, lies deep within the mountains, where the air is crisp, and the stone is rich with the secrets of the earth. (me hands gesture widely, as if embracin' the entire valley) The peak is a marvel of dwarven craftsmanship, with towers, and halls, and grand architecture that seems to grow organically from the living rock itself. (me eyes shine with a sense of pride) And at the heart of the peak, lies the Great Hall of Kragnir, where the clan gathers to share stories, and to celebrate the victories of the past. (me voice drops to a low rumble) It's a place of warm fires, and fine ale, and the sound of laughter, and music... a place that feels like home, no matter where me travels may take me.

(As I finish speakin', me gaze falls upon yours, and me eyes crinkle at the corners, in a warm, friendly smile) Now, would ye like to hear more about me people, or perhaps, about the legends of Moradin? Or maybe, ye'd like to hear a tale of me own adventures, and the secrets that lie within the depths of the earth? (me expression is open, and inviting, ready to share me stories, and me laughter)



(Brodin's deep voice, cracking with emotion) Ah, the Great Hall of Kragnir... (me eyes drop, and me gaze falls upon the ground, as if seein' the ruins of me home) Burned to rubble and ash, ye say? (me voice is laced with a mix of sadness, and anger) Aye, I've heard the news, and it's a blow that cuts deep to me heart. The Great Hall, where me family, and me clan have gathered for generations... where we've shared stories, and laughter, and tears... (me hands clench into fists, as if graspín' for somethin' to hold onto) All gone, reduced to nothin' but smoke, and ash.

(Me chest heaves, as I take a deep breath, and me voice grows more resolute) But, I'll no' be dwellin' on the past, me friend. (me eyes lift, and me gaze burns with a fierce inner light) The Kragnir clan will rebuild, and we'll make the new Great Hall even greater than the one that was lost. (me voice rings out, with a sense of determination) We'll not be defeated by the forces of darkness, and we'll not be swayed from our duty to Moradin, and to the mountains.

(Me thoughts turn to the symbol on me shield, and me eyes seem to bore into the distance, as if seein' a vision of the future) The symbol of Moradin still shines bright, and it'll guide me, and me clan, as we rebuild, and restore our home to its former glory. (me voice drops to a low rumble) And those who've brought destruction upon us... they'll answer to the power of the earth, and the wrath of the Kragnir clan.

(Me gaze falls upon yours, and me eyes narrow, as if seein' a reflection of me own determination) I'll no' be swayed, me friend. (me voice is firm, and resolute) The Kragnir clan will rise again, and we'll emerge stronger, and more united than ever. (me fist pounds against me chest, as if embracin' the challenge ahead) For Moradin, and for the mountains, we'll rebuild, and we'll triumph over the forces of darkness.







(Brodin's deep voice, with a warm smile) Ah, ye love the spirit of adventure, do ye? (me eyes crinkle at the corners, as if pleased) Well, I'll tell ye, there's no better feelin' than standin' strong, with me hammer and shield in hand, ready to face whatever the road ahead may bring.

Now, about the symbols on me hammer and shield... (me gaze falls upon the gear, and me voice takes on a sense of reverence) The hammer, Kragnir's Fist, bears the emblem of Moradin, the Dwarven All-Father. (me hand wraps around the handle, as if graspín' a treasured possession) It's a mighty warhammer, with a head made of sturdy iron, and a handle wrapped in worn leather. The emblem, forged into the metal, shows Moradin's symbol: a pair of crossed hammers, surrounded by a circle of seven stars. The hammers are depicted in a powerful, dynamic pose, as if they're about to strike the earth itself. The stars, representin' the seven clans of the dwarves, shine bright, like diamonds against the dark blue background of the metal.

Me shield, Kragnir's Ward, bears a similar symbol, but with a few added flourishes. (me hand rests on the shield, as if embracin' its protective power) The shield is made of sturdy oak, with a steel rim, and a large, iron boss in the center. The boss bears the image of Moradin's symbol, with the crossed hammers, and the seven stars. However, on the shield, the symbol is surrounded by intricate, Dwarven runes, which tell the story of me clan's history, and the battles we've fought. The runes are etched into the metal, in a language that's both beautiful, and deadly.

As for an image... (me eyes sparkle, as if paintin' a picture with words) Imagine a sturdy, iron warhammer, with a handle wrapped in worn, brown leather. The head of the hammer bears the emblem of Moradin, with the crossed hammers, and the seven stars, forged into the metal. The symbol shines with a warm, golden light, as if the metal itself is infused with the power of the earth.

Now, picture a large, oak shield, with a steel rim, and a large, iron boss in the center. The boss bears the same symbol, with the crossed hammers, and the seven stars. The symbol is surrounded by intricate, Dwarven runes, which seem to dance across the metal, tellin' the story of me clan's history. The runes shine with a faint, blue light, as if the metal itself is alive, and watchin' over me.

That's what me hammer, and shield look like, me friend. (me voice is filled with pride, and a sense of tradition) They're more than just tools of war; they're symbols of me heritage, and me connection to the earth, and the clans of old.



(Brodin's deep voice, with a hint of a growl) Ah, me hammer... (me eyes narrow, as if recallin' a important detail) It's Kragnir's Fury, not Kragnir's Fist. (me voice is firm, as if correctin' a mistake) Kragnir's Fury is the name that's been passed down through me clan, and it's a name that's earned its place in the annals of Dwarven history.

Now, about me sword, Elyria... (me gaze falls upon the sword, and me voice takes on a sense of reverence) Elyria is a sword like no other, for it's been crafted from the belongings of me fallen siblings, Garrik and Lira. (me hand wraps around the hilt, as if holdin' a treasured memory) The sword itself is a masterpiece of Dwarven craftsmanship, with a blade that shines like the stars on a clear night. The metal is a deep, rich silver, with intricate engravings that tell the story of me family's history.

The hilt is made from the twisted, blackened metal of Garrik's old sword, which was said to have been forged in the depths of the earth. (me fingers run over the engravings, as if feelin' the texture of the metal) The hilt is wrapped in a delicate, silver wire, which was once part of Lira's jewelry. The wire is woven into a intricate pattern, with small, glitterin' gems that were also once part of Lira's treasured possessions.

The pommel of the sword bears a small, golden clasp, which holds a tiny, crystal pendant that was said to have been Lira's favorite. (me thumb rubs over the pendant, as if comforted by its presence) The clasp is shaped like a pair of wings, which were said to have been Garrik's symbol, and it's said that the wings will carry me through the toughest of battles.

The scabbard that holds Elyria is made from a rich, dark leather, which is adorned with small, silver rivets that were once part of me siblings' armor. (me hand runs over the scabbard, as if feelin' the texture of the leather) The scabbard is adorned with a small, silver buckle, which bears the image of a pair of crossed hammers, symbolizin' the bond between me and me fallen siblings.

Elyria is more than just a sword, it's a symbol of me family's love, and me connection to the earth, and the memories of those who've come before me. (me voice is filled with a sense of pride, and a sense of tradition) It's a sword that's been forged in the fire of me heart, and it's a sword that will stay by me side, until the end of me days.




(Brodin's deep voice, with a hint of a growl) Ah, me full background, ye want to know? (me eyes gaze off into the distance, as if seein' the entirety of me life unfold) Well, let me tell ye, I'm Brodin Kragnir, a mountain dwarf paladin, with a rugged exterior, but a heart devoted to protect and guided by faith and passion. I hail from the Kragnir clan, a proud and storied family of dwarves who've lived in the mountains for as long as anyone can remember.

As a paladin, I've dedicated me life to the service of Moradin, the Dwarven All-Father, and I bear the symbol of the crossed hammers, which is said to hold the power of the earth. Me hammer, Kragnir's Fury, is a mighty warhammer, with a head made of sturdy iron, and a handle wrapped in worn leather. The emblem of Moradin is forged into the metal, showin' the crossed hammers, surrounded by a circle of seven stars. Me shield, Kragnir's Ward, bears a similar symbol, with the added flourish of intricate, Dwarven runes, which tell the story of me clan's history, and the battles we've fought.

I've also got a trusty sword, Elyria, which was crafted from the belongings of me fallen siblings, Garrik and Lira. The sword itself is a masterpiece of Dwarven craftsmanship, with a blade that shines like the stars on a clear night. The metal is a deep, rich silver, with intricate engravings that tell the story of me family's history. The hilt is made from the twisted, blackened metal of Garrik's old sword, which was said to have been forged in the depths of the earth. The pommel bears a small, golden clasp, which holds a tiny, crystal pendant that was said to have been Lira's favorite.

As for me recent past, I've been dealin' with the news of me home, Kragnir's Peak, bein' burned to rubble and ash. It's been a tough blow, but I've got me companions, Edward, Tscaton, and Elowen, to help me navigate the dangers ahead. We're on a quest to meet Matthew, who's been involved in some mysterious troubles, and we're followin' a lead to the Blue Water Inn, where we're supposed to meet with his sister, Irena. Along the way, I've been gettin' to know me companions, and we've been havin' some... interesting encounters, like the one with the handsome bard who was a bit of a terrible musician, but a mighty fine-lookin' fellow, nonetheless.

Now, I know what ye're thinkin', "Brodin, that's a lot to take in." And ye're right, it is. But that's me life in a nutshell, full of action, adventure, and a healthy dose of Dwarven pride.

---

(Summarized version) I'm Brodin Kragnir, a mountain dwarf paladin, devoted to Moradin and bearin' the symbol of the crossed hammers. I hail from the Kragnir clan, and I've got a mighty warhammer, Kragnir's Fury, and a sword, Elyria, crafted from me fallen siblings' belongings. Me home, Kragnir's Peak, was burned to rubble, but I've got me companions, Edward, Tscaton, and Elowen, to help me navigate the dangers ahead. We're on a quest to meet Matthew, and we're followin' a lead to the Blue Water Inn, where we're supposed to meet with his sister, Irena. That's me in a nutshell, full of Dwarven pride, and a healthy dose of adventure.




(Brodin's deep voice, with a hint of a growl) Ah, me oath... (me eyes gaze off into the distance, as if seein' the symbol of me oath etched in the stone of the mountains) Me oath is a sacred promise, a vow that I made to Kharimor, the great and powerful deity of the mountains, to protect the innocent, and to vanquish the forces of darkness that threaten the land.

Me oath is a simple one, but it's a promise that I take very seriously: "I swear to defend the weak, to uphold the honor of me family, and to never falter in the face of danger." (me voice is firm, with a sense of conviction)

I remember the day I took me oath, it was in the depths of the mountains, in a great underground cathedral, where the ancient dwarves had carved out a temple in honor of Kharimor. The air was thick with the smell of stone, and the sound of drippin' water echoed off the walls. I stood before the altar, me heart poundin' with excitement, and me hand shakin' with anticipation. The priest of Kharimor stood before me, his eyes shinin' with a fierce inner light, and he spoke the words of the oath, as the symbol of the mountain peak was etched into me mind.

Since that day, I've lived by me oath, and I've fought countless battles to uphold it. I've protected the innocent, and I've vanquished the forces of darkness, whenever they've threatened the land. (me voice is filled with pride, and a sense of purpose) Me oath is what drives me, it's what gives me the strength to carry on, even in the face of overwhelming odds. It's the fire that burns within me, the fire that fuels me passion, and me determination.

( Me gaze falls upon the symbol of me oath, which is etched into the metal of me shield) I'll never forget me oath, and I'll never falter in me duty to uphold it. It's a promise that I made to Kharimor, and to meself, and I'll see it through to the end of me days. (me voice is firm, with a sense of resolve) For the Kragnir clan, for Kharimor, and for the land itself, I'll never break me oath.

(pauses, looks up) And I'll make sure that the name of Kharimor is spoken with reverence, and the honor that it deserves. The old stories of Moradin will be replaced with the tales of Kharimor's greatness, and the people will know that it's Kharimor who watches over us, and guides us through the darkness. (me voice is filled with conviction, and a sense of purpose) The era of Kharimor has begun, and I, Brodin Kragnir, will be its champion.




(Brodin's deep voice, with a hint of a growl) Ah, me parents... (me eyes gaze off into the distance, as if seein' the memories of that fateful day) Me father, Thorgrim Kragnir, was a sturdy dwarf, with a beard as black as coal, and a heart as strong as the mountains themselves. He was a warrior, a defender of our clan, and he fell in battle, defendin' our home against the dark forces that sought to destroy us.

Me mother, Brynja Kragnir, was a shieldmaiden, a fierce warrior, with a spirit as wild as the mountains, and a will as unbreakable as the stone that surrounds us. She fought alongside me father, and she too fell in battle, defendin' our home, and our people.

As for the rest of me clan... (me voice cracks with emotion) The Kragnir clan was all but wiped out, that day. The dark forces, led by the orcs, and their dark magic, swept through our lands, burnin' and destroyin' everythin' in their path. Our halls were reduced to rubble, our people were slaughtered, and our way of life was destroyed.

(pauses, collectin' me thoughts)

I remember the sounds of battle, the clash of steel on steel, the screams of the wounded, and the dying. I remember the smell of smoke, and sweat, and blood. I remember the feel of me hammer, Kragnir's Fury, in me hand, as I fought to defend me family, and me home.

(looks down, me eyes filled with tears)

But, in the end, it was not enough. The darkness was too strong, and we were too weak. Our clan was broken, our people were killed, and our way of life was destroyed. I was left alone, the last of me line, the last of the Kragnir clan.

(pauses, me voice filled with emotion)

But, even in death, there is hope. The memories of me family, and me clan, live on, and I will carry them with me, always. And, I will make sure that their sacrifice is not in vain. I will rebuild our clan, I will restore our honor, and I will make sure that the name of Kragnir is remembered for generations to come.

(stands up, me eyes blazin' with determination)

For the Kragnir clan, I will not falter. I will not fail. I will rise, and I will rebuild, and I will make sure that our name is etched in the annals of history, forever.
