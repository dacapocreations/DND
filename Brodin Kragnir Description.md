Brodin Kragnir is a mountain dwarf, standing a stout 4'8" with a powerfully built frame. His skin is a deep tan, weathered by the mountain sun and wind, hinting at a life spent outdoors. His beard, long and braided with intricate silver rings, is a fiery red, streaked with patches of grey that speak to his age and experience. His eyes are a piercing blue, sharp and observant, often narrowed with focus. He wears sturdy, well-worn plate armor, bearing the crest of his clan â€“ a stylized mountain peak. A holy symbol of his deity, a shining silver hammer, hangs prominently around his neck. He carries a warhammer, its head polished to a gleaming shine, and a shield emblazoned with his clan's symbol. A determined, yet kind, set to his jaw suggests a man of unwavering resolve and a compassionate heart.
