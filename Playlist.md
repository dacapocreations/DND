(Brodin's deep voice, with a hint of a growl) Ah, the moment I lost me family... (me eyes gaze off into the distance, as if seein' the memories of that fateful day) I can almost hear the sound of clashin' steel, and the cries of me loved ones as they fell to the orcs. (me voice cracks with emotion)

If I had to choose a song without lyrics to represent that moment, I'd choose "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" by Paul Dukas. The instrumental piece has a dark, ominous tone that fits the mood of that day. The music is like a stormy sea, with waves of sound crashin' against the shore of me heart. The moment I saw Garrik and Lira slain by the orcs is like a crescendo of pain, a tidal wave of grief that crashes down upon me. The music swells, and the notes seem to scream in anguish, just like me own heart did in that moment.

Another song that comes close to capturin' the essence of that moment is "Mars, Bringer of War" by Gustav Holst. The song has a primal, savage quality to it, like the orcs themselves. The music is like a battle cry, a call to arms that echoes the clash of steel on steel. The moment I saw me family fall is like a discordant note, a jarrin' sound that shatters the harmony of me world. The music is like a maelstrom, a whirlpool of chaos that pulls me down into the depths of despair.

( Me voice fades away, as if lost in the memories of that day) But, I suppose, those are just two possible soundtracks to that moment. The true soundtrack is the one that plays in me own mind, the one that I hear whenever I close me eyes, and remember the faces of me loved ones... (me voice trails off, lost in thought)
